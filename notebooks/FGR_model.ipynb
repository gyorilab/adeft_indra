       "'We next sought to determine whether specimens harboring mutant  CSF3R  show in vitro sensitivity to small-molecule inhibitors of kinases or siRNA directed against kinases that become dysregulated downstream of mutant CSF3R. Analysis of cells from Patient 3, who had CNL with the  CSF3R  S783fs mutation ( Table S3 and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix ), revealed dramatic sensitivity to the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib (Sprycel, Bristol-Myers Squibb) but no sensitivity to inhibitors of JAK family kinases ( Fig. 1B ). Further interrogation with our panel of tyrosine kinase– specific siRNAs revealed sensitivity to silencing of tyrosine kinase nonreceptor 2 (TNK2) and an SRC family kinase, FGR, both of which are potently inhibited by dasatinib  36  ( Fig. 1C ). We also performed drug-sensitivity profiling on samples from two patients with the  CSF3R  T618I mutation (one with CNL and one with ETP-T-ALL). In contrast to the drug-sensitivity pattern in the patients with truncation mutations, both samples showed sensitivity to inhibitors that target JAK family kinases (including ruxolitinib [Jakafi, Incyte]) but resistance to dasatinib ( Fig. 1D , and  Fig. S3D and S3E in the Supplementary Appendix ). Taken together, the functional genomic data on the samples from these three patients suggest that there are two different classes of  CSF3R  mutations: truncation mutations, which result in dysregulation of SRC family–TNK2 kinases, and membrane proximal mutations, which result in dysregulation of JAK family kinases. The data also suggest that truncation mutations confer sensitivity to dasatinib but not to JAK kinase inhibitors, where-as the reverse is true for membrane proximal mutant cells.\\nOnce we confirmed the transformation capacity of the  CSF3R  mutations, we investigated the differential signaling and drug sensitivity suggested by our functional screening of samples of  CSF3R  mutant leukemia. Ba/F3 cells expressing the T618I or S783fs mutation before or after interleukin-3–independent transformation, along with cells expressing wild-type CSF3R or parental control cells, were starved of the interleukin-3 growth factor, and cell lysates were analyzed by means of immunoblotting. The cells with the S783fs mutation showed higher expression of CSF3R than did the cells with the wild-type allele ( Fig. 1F ), and this difference was magnified after long-term culture in the absence of interleukin-3, a finding consistent with results of previous studies showing disruption of receptor internalization in the context of truncation mutations. 22 – 24 , 37  After withdrawal of interleukin-3, Ba/F3 cells with  CSF3R  mutations expressed high levels of endogenous TNK2 and increased phosphorylation of SRC family kinases, providing validation of the initial TNK2 and FGR siRNA sensitivities observed in samples obtained from a patient with a  CSF3R  truncation mutation ( Fig. 1C ) and suggesting that TNK2 is a previously unrecognized downstream mediator of CSF3R signaling.\\nPanel A shows the location and recurrence of  CSF3R  mutations found in samples from 16 of 27 patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) or atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), along with samples from patients with other types of leukemia. The mutation locations and number of observations are indicated by black circles. The Q741X mutation was found in a sample obtained from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and one of the T618I mutations was found in a sample from a patient with early T-cell precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-T-ALL). Five patients with CNL or atypical CML had both membrane proximal and truncation mutations. (For details, see  Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix .) Two additional  CSF3R  mutations (Q739X and T618I, which are not shown) have been reported in AML specimens sequenced by the Cancer Genome Atlas. 21 \\n CSF3R  coordinates are numbered according to the conventions of the Ensembl genome browser, a numbering system that differs from historical  CSF3R  numbering owing to the inclusion of the 23-amino-acid signal peptide, despite the absence of this signal peptide from the mature protein. Panel B shows the sensitivity of white cells from Patient 3, who had CNL and a  CSF3R  S783fs mutation ( Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix ), to a panel of 66 small-molecule kinase inhibitors. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of each drug is plotted as a percentage of the median IC  50  for each drug from 150 samples obtained from patients with leukemia. 35  A specimen was considered to be hypersensitive to an inhibitor if the IC 50  was less than 10% of the median IC 50  for that inhibitor for the entire cohort (as indicated by the dashed red line). This specimen was hypersensitive to dasatinib (green) and insensitive to JAK kinase inhibitors (orange). SFK denotes SRC-family kinase, and TNK2 tyrosine kinase nonreceptor 2. Panel C shows the sensitivity of white cells from Patient 3 to small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) directed against all known tyrosine kinases, as described previously. 33 , 34  Silencing of TNK2 and an SRC family kinase, FGR, resulted in a substantial decrease in cell viability. All cell-viability values after silencing with each individual siRNA have been normalized to the median value of the entire panel. The bars on the graph represent the mean normalized cell viability from triplicate data points for each individual siRNA. The T bars represent standard errors. The black horizontal line indicates the mean of all values across the entire siRNA panel, and the red dashed line indicates a threshold of significance, which is calculated as the mean minus 2 SD for all values. In addition to carrying the CSF3R S783fs mutation, Patient 3 had a minority of clones with a  CSF3R  S783fs–T615A compound mutation, but this small percentage of cells did not have an effect on sensitivity to inhibitors in short-term assays. Panel D shows the sensitivity of white cells from a patient with ETP-T-ALL and a  CSF3R  T618I mutation to the same panel of 66 small-molecule kinase inhibitors that was used to test cells from Patient 3, as described in Panel B. These cells were insensitive to dasatinib (green) and sensitive to JAK kinase inhibitors (orange). Panel E shows interleukin-3–dependent Ba/F3 cells that were infected with murine retrovirus expressing wild-type  CSF3R , membrane proximal mutations, or truncation mutations. Uninfected parental Ba/ F3 cells and empty-vector infected Ba/F3 cells were used as controls. Over a 10-day period, both classes of  CSF3R  mutations were capable of transforming Ba/F3 cells to interleukin-3–independent growth, and the membrane proximal mutations (T615A and T618I) transformed cells in this assay substantially faster than the truncation mutants (Q741X and S783fs). Panel F shows Ba/F3 cells expressing  CSF3R  T618I or S783fs mutations before or after interleukin-3– independent transformation (IL3- indicates transformed cells). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis for CSF3R, TNK2, phospho-STAT3 (pSTAT3), total STAT3, phospho-JAK2 (pJAK2), total JAK2, phospho-SRC (pSRC), total SRC, and actin. Parental Ba/F3 cells or Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type CSF3R were included as controls.\\n'"
