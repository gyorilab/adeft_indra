       "'Morphine has cardioprotective effects against ischemic-reperfusion injuries. This study investigates whether morphine could mimic the antiapoptotic effect of preconditioning using a model of cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes subjected to metabolic inhibition (MI). To quantify MI-induced apoptosis, DNA fragmentation and mitochondrial cytochrome c release levels were measured by ELISA. MI-dependent DNA fragmentation was prevented by both Z-VAD-fmk (20 microM), a pan-caspase inhibitor, and cyclosporine A (CsA; 5 microM), a mitochondrial pore transition blocker, added during MI (36% and 54% decrease, respectively). MI-dependent cytochrome c release was not blocked by Z-VAD-fmk but was decreased (38%) by CsA during MI. Metabolic preconditioning (MIP) and preconditioning with morphine (1 microM) were also assessed. MI-dependent DNA fragmentation and cytochrome c release were prevented by MIP (40% and 45% decrease, respectively) and morphine (34% and 45%, respectively). The antiapoptotic effect of morphine was abolished by naloxone (10 nM), a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist, or xestospongin C (XeC, 400 nM), an inhibitor of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P(3)]-mediated Ca(2+) release. Ca(2+) preconditioning, induced by increasing extracellular Ca(2+) from 1.8 to 3.3 mM, mimicked the antiapoptotic effect of morphine on DNA fragmentation (24% decrease) and cytochrome c release (57% decrease). This effect mediated by extracellular Ca(2+) was also abolished by XeC. Measurements of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration using fura-2 microspectrofluorimetry showed that morphine induces Ins(1,4,5)P(3)-dependent Ca(2+) transients abolished by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), a cell-permeable Ins(1,4,5)P(3) antagonist. These results suggest that morphine preconditioning prevents simulated ischemia-reperfusion-induced apoptosis via an Ins(1,4,5)P(3) signaling pathway in rat ventricular myocytes.\\n'"

       "'Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which have multipotential differentiation and self-renewal potential, are possible cells for tissue engineering. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) can be produced by MSCs in an inactive form, and the activation of TGFβ1 functions as an important regulator of osteogenic differentiation in MSCs. Recently, studies showed that GARP participated in the activation of latent TGFβ1, but the interaction between GARP and TGFβ1 is still undefined. In our study, we successfully isolated the MSCs from bone marrow of rats, and showed that GARP was detected in bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). During the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, GARP expression was increased over time. To elucidate the interaction between GARP and TGFβ1, we downregulated GARP expression in BMSCs to examine the level of active TGFβ1. We then verified that the downregulation of GARP decreased the secretion of active TGFβ1. Furthermore, osteogenic differentiation experiments, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity analyses and Alizarin Red S staining experiments were performed to evaluate the osteogenic capacity. After the downregulation of GARP, ALP activity and Alizarin Red S staining significantly declined and the osteogenic indicators, ALP, Runx2, and OPN, also decreased, both at the mRNA and protein levels. These results demonstrated that downregulated GARP expression resulted in the reduction of TGFβ1 and the attenuation of osteoblast differentiation of BMSCs in vitro .'"
