       "'1. Extracellular K+ activity and transmembrane potential were simultaneously monitored with a K+-selective micro-electrode placed in the extracellular space and a standard KCl-filled micro-electrode in the intracellular space of the frog ventricular muscle. 2. K+ was found to accumulate during activity and had the approximate magnitude and time course to account for the measured membrane depolarization. 3. The magnitude of the K+ accumulation depended on the frequency of stimulation, diameter of the muscle and temperature of the bathing solution. 4. The time constants of accumulation and decay were dependent only on the diameter and the temperature of the strip. A Q10 of 2 was measured for the decay of accumulated K+. 5. Double barrelled K+-electrodes were used to monitor the change in K+ activity accompanying a single action potential, since the reference barrel allowed for rapid compensation of the electrical potential fluctuations encountered in the subendothelial space. 6. K+ accumulated continuously during the plateau to a level which increased external K concentration by about 1 mM. This increase in the subendothelial space corresponds to about 1-3 muA/cm2 or 10-30 pmole/cm2-sec-1 of net K+ efflux. These values are at least an order of magnitude larger than required to discharge the membrane capacitance. 7. There is no direct relation between action potential duration and rate of development or magnitude of K+ accumulation during that action potential. 8. Increase in the external K concentration, while shortening the action potential and depolarizing the membrane, does not lead to an increased rate of accumulation of K+. The presence of Ni2+, on the other hand, prolongs the action potential and decreases the rate of K+ accumulation. 9. The results suggest that there is a substantial and continuous efflux of K+ during the action potential, which sums during rapid beating, resulting in membrane depolarization and alteration of action potential duration. The change in action potential duration in response to rate may be caused by alteration of EK in the local micro-environments.\\n'"

       "'The OsPCS2 exhibits root- and shoot-specific differential ratios of alternatively spliced transcripts in indica rice under Cd stress, and plays role in Cd and As stress tolerance and accumulation. Enzymatic activity of phytochelatin synthase (PCS) in plant produces phytochelatins, which help in sequestration of heavy metal(loid)s inside the cell vacuole to alleviate toxicity. Here we report that among the two PCS genes-OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 in indica rice (Oryza sativa) cultivar, the OsPCS2 produces an alternatively spliced OsPCS2b transcript that bears the unusual premature termination codon besides the canonically spliced OsPCS2a transcript. Root- and shoot-specific differential ratios of alternatively spliced OsPCS2a and OsPCS2b transcript expressions were observed under cadmium stress. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells transformed with OsPCS2a exhibited increased cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) tolerance and accumulation, unlike the OsPCS2b transformed yeast cells. An intron-containing hairpin RNA-mediated gene silencing was carried out in endosperm-specific manner for efficient down-regulation of OsPCS genes in rice grains. Analysis of the transgenic rice lines grown under metal(loid) stress revealed almost complete absence of both OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 transcripts in the developing seeds coupled with the significant reduction in the content of Cd (~51%) and As (~35%) in grains compared with the non-transgenic plant. Taken together, the findings indicate towards a crucial role played by the tissue-specific alternative splicing and relative abundance of the OsPCS2 gene during heavy metal(loid) stress mitigation in rice plant.\\n'"
