       "('To report a case of superficial punctate keratopathy (SPK) which coexisted with floppy eyelid syndrome (FES) and presented as intermittent red eye and blurred vision in an 11-year-old boy who slept in the prone position. His condition did not improve despite treatment with topical antibiotics (levofloxacin, tobramycin), steroid eye drops (prednisolone), and artificial tears. The patient was diagnosed with tonsil hypertrophy and nasopharyngeal adenoid hypertrophy and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). He underwent tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. Then he started sleeping in the supine position postoperatively. The SPK, red eye and blurred vision completely resolved after surgery without additional treatment. The corneal sensation also recovered gradually during the next 7 years. However, the floppy eyelid did not resolve.\\nKnown causes of superficial punctate keratopathy (SPK) in children include entropion, keratoconjunctivitis, and eye-drop toxicity [ 1 – 3 ]. However, there are some cases of SPK where the cause is not clearly identified. Here, we describe a case of childhood SPK that coexisted with floppy eyelid syndrome (FES) and presented as intermittent red eye and blurred vision which was diagnosed with tonsil hypertrophy and nasopharyngeal adenoid hypertrophy and rehabilitated by a surgical approach.\\nIt is known that OSAS leads to FES because chronic hypoxia at night leads to degradation of elastin and collagen in the eyelid [ 5 ,  6 ]. The association between FES and OSAS is well known, as is that between FES and keratopathy. However, FES, OSAS and related keratopathy are reported to happen in obese adults who snore at night [ 12 – 14 ] but rarely seen in pediatric patients. The unusual complaints, clinical findings and its association with rhinopharyngeal abnormalities in this case were easily neglected by both ophthalmologists and pediatricians.\\nIt has been reported that chronic rhinitis in children is related to adenoid hypertrophy, thereby causing upper airway obstruction leading to OSAS, especially at night [ 15 ,  16 ]. When the patient was in the supine position the retro-displacement of the tongue root worsened the upper airway obstruction and hence, the child resorted to the prone position during sleeping. As a result of the easy upper eyelid eversion in FES, the right-sided prone position caused the right eyelid to move away from the eyeball, leading to dryness of the ocular surface and subsequent corneal lesion and edema in the morning that manifested as redness and blurred vision. Once the patient was awake, the eyelid returned to the normal position, the conjunctival congestion disappeared, and the corneal edema resolved. Subsequently, the patient’s vision became clearer and the corneal lesion also decreased over time. However, the punctate lesion remained. The severity of the symptoms depended on the sleeping conditions and presented intermittently over the week.\\n',\n",
