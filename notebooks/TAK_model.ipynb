       "'EFS (2–32 Hz) induced frequency-dependent contractions of prostate strips, which were inhibited by SBE 13 (1 μM), cyclapolin 9 (3 μM), TAK 960 (100 nM), and Ro 3280 (100 nM) ( Figure  4 ). Two-way ANOVA was conducted to compare inhibitor and control groups, and indicated that the inhibition by SBE 13 ( p  < 0.02), cyclapolin 9 ( p  < 0.03), TAK 960 ( p  < 0.007), and Ro 3280 ( p  < 0.04) was significant. Multivariate analysis revealed that inhibition was significant for all four inhibitors at least at 32 Hz ( Figure  4 ).\\nEffects of SBE 13 (1 μM), cyclapolin 9 (3 μM), TAK 960 (100 nM), and Ro 3280 (100 nM) on EFS-induced prostate contractions. In an organ bath, contractions of human prostate strips were induced by EFS. Effects of inhibitors on contractions were compared with corresponding controls (DMSO) in separate sets of experiments. To eliminate heterogeneities including any individual variations, different degree of BPH, or varying smooth muscle content (compare  Figure  1 ), tensions have been expressed as % of highmolar KCl-induced contraction, which was assessed before application of inhibitors or solvent. Data are means ± SEM from series with tissues from  n  = 7 patients/group for SBE 13,  n  = 7 patients/group for cyclapolin 9,  n  = 7 patients/groups for TAK 960, and  n  = 10 patients/group for Ro 3280. For each diagram, samples from each patient were allocated to both the control and inhibitor groups, so that both groups in each diagram are obtained from the same tissues ( ∗ p  < 0.05 for control vs. inhibitor).\\nIncubation of prostate tissues with SBE 13 (1 μM), cyclapolin 9 (3 μM), Ro 3280 (100 nM), or TAK 960 (100 nM) for 60 min reduced the average content of phospho-vimentin (serine 56). This was significant for Ro 3280 ( p  < 0.05) and TAK960 ( p  < 0.009), while a trend was observed for SBE 13 and cyclapolin 9 ( Figure  8 ). In contrast, none of the inhibitors changed the content of total vimentin, phospho-MLC (serine 19), or MLC ( Figure  8 ).\\nEffects of PLK inhibitors on phosphorylation of vimentin and MLC. Prostate tissues were incubated with PLK inhibitors and equivalent amounts of solvent (DMSO) for 60 min. Two sets of experiments were performed, where effects of SBE 13 (1 μM) and cyclapolin 9 (3 μM), or of Ro 3280 (100 nM) and TAK 960 (100 nM) were assessed. Vimentin phosphorylation at serine 56 and MLC phosphorylation at serine 19 were compared between inhibitor-treated samples and corresponding controls (exposed to identical experimental conditions) by Western blot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies. In each series, tissues in the agonist and corresponding control group were obtained from the same prostates. Shown are representative Western blots and quantification of all experiments, from series with  n  = 8 patients the SBE 13/cyclapolin 9 series, and  n  = 8 other patients for the Ro 3280/TAK960 series ( ∗ p  < 0.05 for control vs. inhibitor).\\nFollowing the discovery of PLK1 as important regulator of mitosis and proliferation in different cell types, PLKs emerged as promising new targets in oncology ( McInnes et al., 2005 ). This initiated the development of PLK-specific small molecule inhibitors, which has been promoted during the last decade and resulted in several inhibitors which are now available for research purposes ( Gutteridge et al., 2016 ). In kinase assays based on immunoprecipitated enzymes, SBE 13 showed high selectivity for PLK1, with an IC 50  value of 200 pM for PLK1 inhibition, and IC 50  values of 66 μM and 875 nM for inhibition of PLK2 and -3, while no inhibition of aurora kinase was observed ( Keppner et al., 2009 ,  2010 ). In different cell lines, including HeLa and cancer cells, proliferation was inhibited with EC 50  values ranging between 5 and 60 μM ( Keppner et al., 2009 ,  2010 ). Cyclapolin 9 showed an IC 50  of 500 nM for PLK1 in  in vitro  kinase assays, while a panel of at least 37 other kinases was not inhibited even at a cyclapolin 9 concentration of 100 μM ( McInnes et al., 2006 ). Ro 3280 inhibited PLK1 with an IC 50  value of 3 nM in biochemical assays, and 6 nM in H82 cells ( Chen et al., 2012 ). Even at a concentration of 1 μM, Ro 3280 inhibited only 13 out of a panel of 293 tested kinases ( Chen et al., 2012 ). EC 50  values for the inhibition of proliferation in 13 different tumor cell lines ranged between 6 and 82 nM, with 12 nM for prostatic PC-3 cells ( Chen et al., 2012 ). TAK-960 inhibits PAK1 with an IC 50  of 1.5–2 nM, and is orally available ( Hikichi et al., 2012 ;  Nie et al., 2013 ). Proliferation of cultured cancer cells was effectively inhibited by TAK-960 in a low, one-digit nanomolar range ( Nie et al., 2013 ). At a concentration of 1 μM, 243 of 288 tested kinases were inhibited by less than 20% ( Hikichi et al., 2012 ). Therefore and based on the concentrations used in our study (1 μM SBE 13; 3 μM cyclapolin 9; 100 nM Ro 3280; 100 nM TAK-960), we assume that the effects we observed in our experiments using human prostate tissues may be attributed largely to inhibition of PLKs, while unspecific kinase inhibition may play a minor role.\\n'"

       "'The OsPCS2 exhibits root- and shoot-specific differential ratios of alternatively spliced transcripts in indica rice under Cd stress, and plays role in Cd and As stress tolerance and accumulation. Enzymatic activity of phytochelatin synthase (PCS) in plant produces phytochelatins, which help in sequestration of heavy metal(loid)s inside the cell vacuole to alleviate toxicity. Here we report that among the two PCS genes-OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 in indica rice (Oryza sativa) cultivar, the OsPCS2 produces an alternatively spliced OsPCS2b transcript that bears the unusual premature termination codon besides the canonically spliced OsPCS2a transcript. Root- and shoot-specific differential ratios of alternatively spliced OsPCS2a and OsPCS2b transcript expressions were observed under cadmium stress. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells transformed with OsPCS2a exhibited increased cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) tolerance and accumulation, unlike the OsPCS2b transformed yeast cells. An intron-containing hairpin RNA-mediated gene silencing was carried out in endosperm-specific manner for efficient down-regulation of OsPCS genes in rice grains. Analysis of the transgenic rice lines grown under metal(loid) stress revealed almost complete absence of both OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 transcripts in the developing seeds coupled with the significant reduction in the content of Cd (~51%) and As (~35%) in grains compared with the non-transgenic plant. Taken together, the findings indicate towards a crucial role played by the tissue-specific alternative splicing and relative abundance of the OsPCS2 gene during heavy metal(loid) stress mitigation in rice plant.\\n'"
