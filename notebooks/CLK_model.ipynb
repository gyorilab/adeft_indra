       "[('Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) results in increased renal resistance as well as in exaggerated prostaglandin (PG) release from the obstructed hydronephrotic kidney (HNK). We have reported previously that platelet-activating factor (PAF) dose-dependently stimulates the release of PGs from both the HNK and unobstructed contralateral kidney (CLK), with CLK release being 10% that of the HNK. In the present report, we studied the interaction of PAF with its receptor by examining the effects of PAF-receptor antagonists on the release of PGs from the isolated perfused rabbit HNK and CLK stimulated by PAF; angiotensin II (AII), and bradykinin (BK) were also used as agonists. In the HNK, kadsurenone (3 microM) inhibited PAF-stimulated PGE2 and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) release by 28.2 and 62.5% respectively. CV-3988 (20 microM) and triazolam (5 microM) also preferentially diminished PAF-stimulated TxB2 release. In addition, all three drugs significantly diminished BK- and AII-stimulated TxB2 release, while CV-3988 was the only antagonist to affect peptide-stimulated PGE2 release. While effective against agonist-stimulated PG synthesis, these drugs had no direct effect on arachidonic acid metabolism to PGs. Furthermore, in the CLK, CV-3988 had no effect on BK- or AII-stimulated PGE2 release, whereas it totally inhibited PAF-stimulated release of PGE2. These results show that PAF-receptor antagonists in the HNK preferentially inhibit TxB2 release whether stimulated by PAF, AII or BK; in the CLK only PAF-stimulated PG release is affected. This biochemical difference may be of physiological significance and explain some of the functional differences between the HNK and CLK. Therefore, PAF may be an important mediator of some of the biochemical and functional changes associated with UUO.\\n',\n",

Unilateral RAS was induced in two groups, of which one was fed with a high cholesterol diet to induce early atherosclerosis (ARAS), while the other (RAS) consumed regular diet. The third group included normal pigs which served as control sham. Renal function, hemodynamics, tubular function and morphology were assessed using multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) and histology. Diffusion-weighted MR images were acquired at 3T and analyzed using mono and bi-exponential models. ADC and IVIM parameters (Diffusivity (D t ), flow-dependent pseudo-diffusivity (D p ), and fluid fraction (f p )) were calculated in cortex and medulla of the stenotic (STK) and contra-lateral kidneys (CLK). Results were analyzed using ANOVA, student t-test, and regression analysis.\\nIn both RAS and ARAS the STK shrank and the CLK underwent hypertrophy. GFR and renal blood flow declined in STKs, and CLKs manifested hyperfiltration. Additionally, ARAS kidneys showed reduced mean transit time in distal tubular segments. ADC and diffusivity both decreased in STK of RAS and ARAS. D p  and f p  were elevated in both the STK and CLK of RAS and more prominently in ARAS. STK cortical ADC and D t  correlated inversely with the degree of fibrosis, and directly with GFR. Furthermore, D p  correlated with tubular injury score in all kidneys.\\nRenal artery stenosis (RAS) is a vascular disorder, which may result in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and lead to end stage renal failure 1 . Significant RAS compromises renal blood flow (RBF), induces renovascular hypertension, impairs glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and induces interstitial fibrosis in the post-stenotic kidney (STK). While in the Western world atherosclerotic RAS (ARAS) is the predominant etiology in adults, RAS may be caused by other causes like fibromuscular dysplasia 1 . Renal injury in ARAS is more severe because atherogenic factors exacerbate damage in both the STK and the contralateral kidney (CLK) 2 , 3 . Early diagnosis and effective treatment may potentially slow further deterioration of renal function. Different imaging techniques and modalities have been used to detect and investigate mechanisms of renal functional and hemodynamic deterioration, yet assessment of tissue injury and morphological changes in the kidney is difficult without invasive methods 4 â€“ 7 .\\nWe hypothesize that functional and morphological alterations in the swine STK and CLK, illustrated by multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) and histology, would be accompanied by corresponding changes in DWI-derived diffusivity and pseudo-diffusivity calculated using the IVIM model. We further hypothesize that DWI-derived parameters would depict greater renal impairment in pigs with ARAS compared to RAS.\\nResults are presented as meanÂ±SEM. ANOVA was used for STK/CLK comparison and among groups, followed by unpaired t-test. Regression analysis was performed using the least square method, in some cases on a compiled set of corresponding kidneys from all three groups of RAS, ARAS and Sham. For p values â‰¤ 0.05, results were considered significant.\\nTen weeks after RAS induction the degree of stenosis in the RAS and ARAS groups were comparable and MAP was similarly elevated ( Table. 1 ). The cortical and medullary regions of the STKs underwent atrophy and a decrease in RBF, whereas in the CLKs, the cortex showed hypertrophy, and medullary volumes remained unchanged. MDCT-derived GFR was reduced in the STKs and elevated in the CLKs compared to the sham group. Cortical vascular and proximal tubular MTT values were similar among all groups, whereas distal MTT was significantly shorter in the ARAS STK and CLK, and tended to be shorter in RAS as well (p=0.063 and p=0.072 in the STK and CLK, respectively). Cortical perfusion and FBV remained unchanged, while medullary perfusion and FBV declined in all STKs.\\nThe degree of fibrosis was significantly higher in the cortex and medulla of both the STK and CLK of ARAS compared to those in RAS or shams, suggesting greater tissue injury in ARAS. Interstitial fibrosis (trichrome-staining) in the cortex of RAS STK was also greater than Sham ( Figure 2.Aâ€“B ). Medullary fibrosis was elevated compared to sham in all RAS and ARAS kidneys, but again in ARAS more than in RAS. Tubular injury score was significantly higher in the RAS STK and in both ARAS kidneys compared to Sham ( Figure 2.Câ€“D ).\\nRAS STK cortical diffusivity was significantly lower than that in its CLK or in sham, while the RAS CLK and Sham were similar. In contrast, ARAS STK diffusivity was not different than its CLK, yet was reduced compared to the Sham, and tended to decrease in the CLK as well (p= 0.084 vs. sham) ( Figure 3 ). Similarly, in RAS f p  was higher than Sham in the STK and tended to be elevated in the CLK (p=0.060), whereas in ARAS, both were significantly higher compared to sham Control. Finally, cortical pseudo-diffusivity (flow velocity) was elevated in STK and CLK of both RAS and ARAS, except that in the RAS STK the increase has not reached statistical significance (p=0.067).\\nA similar pattern was observed in the medulla, where diffusivity tended to decline in the RAS STK (p=0.091) and in both ARAS STK and CLK (p=0.072 and p=0.095 in RAS and ARAS, respectively and p=0.020 in RAS CLK vs. ARAS CLK) while pseudo-diffusivity was significantly elevated in all STKs and CLKs, except in RAS STK (p=0.058 vs. Sham). f p  was only increased in both ARAS but not RAS kidneys.\\nIn both the cortex and medulla, ADC values were significantly lower in the STK compared to the CLK and Sham, whereas CLK ADC were not different than Sham ( Figure 3.d & 3.h ).\\nCortical and medullary diffusivity and ADC showed strong correlation in all kidneys ( Figure 4 ). In the STK, cortical and medullary diffusivity and ADC, all correlated inversely with the histological degree of fibrosis and in the cortex also with GFR ( Figure 5.Aâ€“B ). Pseudo-diffusion in the cortex of all kidneys correlated inversely with MDCT-derived distal tubular MTT ( Figure 5.C ). Furthermore, STK (but not CLK) cortical f p  showed a modest but significant correlation with MDCT-derived FBV, and inversely correlated with the degree of fibrosis. Tubular injury score correlated with cortical pseudo-diffusivity ( Figure 5.D ).\\nThis study shows that IVIM-based analysis of DWI can detect and distinguish functional and morphological changes in atherosclerotic (ARAS) and non-atherosclerotic RAS kidneys, which agree with comparable assessments, obtained using independent methods. Diffusivity decreased in the STKs and inversely correlated to the histological degree of fibrosis. Fluid fraction and pseudo-diffusivity increased in the RAS STK cortex, and remarkably in both ARAS STK and CLK, suggesting tubular functional and structural alterations, as confirmed by MDCT and histology. Therefore, this study suggests that DWI parameters may serve as biomarkers of kidney injury.\\nThe results of this study indicated that IVIM is capable of unraveling renal morphological and fluid dynamic alterations in RAS and ARAS subjects. Ten weeks after induction of stenosis, we observed hallmarks of RAS, including a decline in STK volume RBF, and GFR, and development of systemic hypertension. Because of the relatively moderate degree of stenosis, the main changes were related to renal volume, so that STK atrophy and compensatory CLK hypertrophy largely preserved regional GFR, FBV, and perfusion 25 . Nevertheless, cortical diffusivity fell in both RAS and ARAS STK and tended to decrease in their medulla as well. Indeed, diffusivity correlated with the level of fibrosis, which was elevated in the RAS STK and in both ARAS kidneys. Smaller diffusivity of ARAS vs. RAS medullary CLK (which was not different than the ARAS STK) was likely attributed to greater fibrosis and structural alterations found in ARAS CLK by histology. Notably, this was consistent with our previous finding that the morphology of the RAS CLK remains largely preserved, whereas in ARAS the additive systemic effects of atherosclerosis and hypertension adversely impact CLK tissue 2 , 3 . Cortical diffusivity also correlated with GFR in the STK. Lack of such correlation in the CLK is particularly interesting, considering that CLK GFR was significantly increased to compensate for the reduced STK GFR. This may imply that the increase in CLK GFR is driven mostly by renal functional rather than structural changes, whereas in the STK, both morphological (e.g. fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis) and hemodynamic factors contribute to the diminished GFR.\\nIn addition to diffusivity, which is often attributed to morphological changes in the tissue 26 , 27 , IVIM analysis yields D p  and f p . D p  has been shown to be sensitive to both vascular blood and tubular fluid velocities 17 , 28 , while f p  is the ratio of vascular and tubular fluid volume to the total fluid in the tissue 19 . Our study suggests that cortical and medullary fluid velocities increased in both ARAS kidneys and in RAS CLK, and tended to rise in the RAS STK. The use of MDCT allowed attributing the increased D p  to tubular flow velocity. Notably, in our model with moderate stenosis and sustained STK perfusion, MDCT showed that vascular MTT remained unchanged, whereas in ARAS kidneys shorter distal tubular MTT implied higher flow velocity in this tubular segment in ARAS kidneys. Remarkably, DWI MRI-derived D p  correlated significantly and inversely with distal tubular MTT, but not with vascular MTT, suggesting that in this study, increases in D p  reflects primarily faster tubular flow variations. In support of this stipulation, D p  also directly correlated with the histological tubular injury score, which established tubular morphological alterations. Some tubular injuries such as cell detachment and intratubular cast formation may affect tubular fluid dynamic by increasing tubular resistance and fluid velocity, yet reducing overall tubular flow and urine volume 29 . Moreover, this speculation is concordant with findings in ischemic tubular injury which shows collecting ducts and particularly distal tubules are the primary cites of obstruction by tubular debris, cells and polymerized Tamm-Horsfall protein 30 . On the other hand, the increase in f p  might have resulted from extracellular matrix accumulation in the atrophic STK 2  that decreases interstitial fluid to a greater extent than tubular fluid volume. This is suggested by the inverse correlation of STK cortical fibrosis and f p .\\nHigher f p  and D p  in the CLK, which is subjected to increased filtration and pressure natriuresis, are concordant with purported increases in healthy subjects during diuresis 19 , as a result of elevated GFR and tubular flow. In our study, CLK hyperfiltration due to the increased arterial pressure also serves as a compensatory mechanism that increases CLK GFR but not the number of nephrons. Hence, an increase in f p  may reflect an increase in tubular flow in response to the CLK fluid overload. These observations suggest that an increase of f p  alone may not distinguish functional from structural underlying causes.\\nTherefore, this study demonstrates that IVIM analysis affords information beyond that provided by ADC, and allows detecting discernible renal alterations in RAS and ARAS. Diffusivity was linked to morphological changes, which were likely driven mainly by fibrosis. D p  might depend on tubular injury in the STK, and on increased tubular flow in the CLK. Similarly, f p  was sensitive to morphological changes in the STK and functional alterations in the CLK. Although currently incapable of differentiating the contribution of the vascular from tubular sub-compartments to f p  and D p , our study implies that IVIM can provide useful markers of renal tubular function. Conceivably a combination of arterial spin labeling and DWI scans may help distinguish these two functional aspects, based on different times-of-flight, and thereby facilitate their interpretation and provide more specific markers for tubular function and hemodynamics. Notably, we also found that morphological and functional alterations in the STK alone could be adequately depicted using ADC. Yet as previous studies have shown, b-value-dependency and inconsistent selection of b-values have complicated derivation of reliable and reproducible values of ADC 14 . Furthermore, the mono-exponential model cannot differentiate the contribution of functional from morphological alterations or distinguish subtle differences in injury severity (ARAS from RAS). Nevertheless, the relative simplicity of use may make analysis of ADC attractive for assessment of renal injury, when considerable in extent.\\nIn conclusion, this study shows that IVIM parameters are sensitive to fibrosis (e.g. mild degree of fibrosis in the CLK) and alterations in tubular flow as a result of functional or structural tubular alterations in unilateral RAS and ARAS. DWI is a powerful method to assess selective pathological markers in the kidney. Independence from exogenous contrast-agents makes this imaging technique appealing to use for patients with chronic kidney disease. Further studies are needed to determine the utility of these techniques in patients with ARAS.\\nTissue Morphology.

Cortical (a,b) and medullary (c,d) fibrosis levels correlated with diffusivity and ADC in corresponding compartments. The two markers also showed significant correlations with GFR (B). Furthermore, perfusion-dependent IVIM parameters showed correlation with renal functional parameters (C). Cortical pseudo-diffusivity correlated with distal tubular MTT in the stenotic kidney (STK) (a) and contra-lateral kidney (CLK) (b). Cortical fluid fraction in the STK showed a moderate but significant correlation with blood volume (c). These two parameters did not correlate in CLK (d). A significant correlation was observed between the pseudo-diffusivity and tubular injury score (D).\\nStenotic Kidney (STK), Contra-lateral Kidney (CLK)\\n',\n",

       " ('Impaired contralateral kidney (CLK) function is important in the maintenance of hypertension in the two-kidney, one-clip (2K, 1C) Goldblatt rat model. Since glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is influenced by the products of arachidonic acid metabolism, we investigated the potential role of eicosanoids as mediators of impaired CLK pressure-volume regulation. At 4 wk following right renal artery clipping, GFR of hypertensive rats was significantly reduced. This decrease was due to the fixed reduction in GFR of the clipped kidney and failure of the CLK to increase its GFR. Thromboxane (Tx) production by isolated perfused CLK was significantly elevated, whereas prostacyclin production remained unchanged. Furthermore, CLK GFR was inversely proportional to Tx production. Treatment of 4-wk hypertensive animals with either the Tx synthase inhibitor UK-38,485 or the Tx receptor antagonist GR 32191 produced a significant increase in CLK GFR. In addition, treatment with either the Tx synthase inhibitor or the Tx receptor antagonist significantly reduced systemic blood pressure. Thus, in this 2K, 1C model of hypertension, increased renal Tx production prevents functional hypertrophy of the contralateral kidney. As a result, CLK pressure-volume regulation is impaired and systemic hypertension is maintained. Furthermore, Tx antagonists restore CLK function and acutely lower systemic blood pressure. Therefore, increased renal Tx production by the CLK appears to be an important mediator of hypertension in the 2K, 1C model.\\n',\n",
