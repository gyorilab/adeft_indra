Pretreatment with IL-lra\\n(1.8/zg/mouse, ICV) blocked the effects of ICV IL-lfl (900 pg/mouse)\\non social behavior. ICV IL-lra (3.6 ,ug/mouse) also attenuated the\\neffects of IP IL-lfl (500 ng/mouse) on social behavior and change in\\nbody weight, suggesting that the effects of peripheral IL-lfl are\\ncentrally mediated. 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.\\nKeywords---Interleukin-1; Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist; Receptor;\\nSocial behavior; Body weight; Mouse.    INTRODUCTION Interleukin-lfl\\n(IL-lfl) is released locally from macrophages and monocytes during the\\ncourse of an infection. It mediates the acute phase response and acts\\non immune cells and distant target organs (Dinarello, 1996).\\nPeripheral and central injections of IL-lfl induce behavioral changes\\nthat are reminiscent of sickness (Dantzer et al., 1991, 1993). These\\nchanges include hypersomnia (Krueger et al., 1990; Obal et al., 1990;\\nOpp & Krueger, 1991), decrease in social activities (Bluth6 et al.,\\n1991, 1995, 1996; Dantzer et al., 1991), alteration o f investigation\\no f a novel environment (Spadaro & Dunn, 1990) and anorexia (Bluth6 et\\nal., 1989). IL-lfl acts on specific receptors that have been\\ncharacterized on peripheral immune targets and are encoded by two\\ndifferent genes. A 80-kDa membrane receptor that binds both I L - I ~\\nand I L - l f l with a similar affinity has been described on T cells\\nand fibroblasts and is called Address correspondence and reprint\\nrequests to: Ms Rose-Marie Bluthr, INRA-INSERM U394, Domaine de\\nCarreire, Rue Camille Saint-SaEns, 33077 Bordeaux Cedex, France (Tel:\\n33 5 57 57 37 16; Fax: 33 5 57 57 37 16; E-mail: rose-\\nmarie.bluthe@bordeaux.inserm.fr).    2    R.-M. Bluth6 et al.    the\\n\\'type I IL-1 receptor\\' (Dripps et al., 1991a; Hannum et al., 1990;\\nMclntyre et al., 1991). The type II receptor is a 68-kDa binding\\nprotein that was originally identified on B cells, and has a higher\\naffinity for IL-lfl than for IL-l~t (Dripps et al., 1991b; McMahan et\\nal., 1991). Type I IL-1 receptor mRNA has been identified in the brain\\nand anterior pituitary by in-situ hybridization techniques (Cunningham\\net al., 1992) and RT-PCR (Parnet et al., 1993, 1994). Although the\\ndistribution of type II IL-1 receptors in the mouse brain has not yet\\nbeen fully described, there is evidence that it is present in the\\npituitary and in the brain (Parnet et al., 1993, 1994). The difference\\nbetween the two receptors is the short cytoplasmic domain of 29 amino-\\nacids for the type II IL-1 receptor that is believed to account for\\nthe lack of biological activity of IL-1 binding on this receptor\\n(McMahan et al., 1991; Sims et al., 1988, 1989). Type II IL-1 receptor\\nis released from the membrane as a soluble protein and inhibits the\\nactivity of IL-1 by acting as a decoy target for this cytokine\\n(Colotta et al., 1993, 1994). Both receptors mediate the central\\neffects of IL-1, but the respective role of each type of receptor in\\nthese effects has not yet been determined. An IL-1 inhibitor has been\\nextracted from the urine of patients with monocytic leukemia\\n(Seckinger & Dayer, 1987). It was purified from adherent monocytes,\\ncloned and sequenced (Eisenberg et al., 1990; Hannum et al., 1990),\\nrevealing a 26% conserved amino acid homology with IL-lfl. This\\ninhibitor has been called the \\'IL-1 receptor antagonist\\' (IL-lra). It\\ncompetes with IL-1 for the occupancy of its cell surface receptors\\n(with a greater affinity for type I IL-1 receptors) and has no agonist\\nactivity. This molecule, in its recombinant form, blocks IL-1 activity\\nboth in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, IL-lra blocks IL-l-induced\\nlymphocyte proliferation (Balavoine et al., 1986; Mclntyre et al.,\\n1991) and synthesis of IL-1, TNF, IL-6 and GM-CSF from monocytes\\n(Granowitz et al., 1991b). It also inhibits the binding of IL-1 to\\nT-cell lines possessing the type I IL-1 receptors present on T ceils\\nand fibroblasts. However, its ability to bind to the type II IL-I\\nreceptors is less clear and appears to depend on the cell type and\\nspecies of origin (Carter et al., 1990; Dripps et al., 1991b;\\nGranowitz et al., 1991a). In vivo, the IL-1 receptor antagonist blocks\\nmost of the inflammatory effects of IL-1 that are mediated by the type\\nI receptors (Arend, 1991). IL-lra blocks IL-l-induced increases in\\ncirculating IL-6 (Mengozzi et al., 1991), fever in rabbits (Ikejima et\\nal., 1991), slow-wave sleep in rabbits (Opp & Krueger, 1991), decrease\\nin social behavior and weight loss in mice and rats (Bluth6 et al.,\\n1991, 1995), hypoglycemia in mice (Vogel et al., 1991), and behavioral\\neffects of a stressor in rats (Maier & Watkins, 1995). We have used\\nthis receptor antagonist in vivo to study the role of brain IL-1\\nreceptors in the behavioral and metabolic effects of IL-I# injected\\nIP. For this purpose, we first established dose-response curves of IP\\nIL-lfl and ICV IL-lfl to select bioactive equivalent doses of IL-I#.\\nWe then calibrated the dose of IL-lra necessary to block the effects\\nof ICV IL-lfl and used this dose to assess the role of brain IL-1\\nreceptors in the brain actions of IP IL-1.    MATERIALS AND METHODS\\nAnimals    Adult male mice of the Crl: CD-1 (ICR) BR strain were used.\\nThey were purchased from Charles River (France) at 6 weeks of age.\\nMice were housed in groups of ten in 42 x 22 17 cm polypropylene cages\\nunder a 12:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 1600h), and at 23 _+ 2.\\nAll behavioral tests were conducted in plastic cages (26 20 x 14 cm)\\nIL-lra Antagonizes Behavioral and Metabolic Effects of IL-1    3\\nwhen the subjects were 8--10 weeks of age (35-40 g). Juvenile male\\nmice (21-28 days of age) of the same strain served as stimulus\\nanimals. They were housed in groups of ten in a different room. Food\\nand water were available ad libitum. Behavioral observations and body\\nweight measurements Sickness induced by IL-lfl was assessed by changes\\nin body weight and decreases in duration of social investigation of a\\nconspecific juvenile introduced into the home cage of the test animal\\n(Bluth6 et al., 1991). All behavioral observations were carried out\\nduring the dark phase of the cycle under red light illumination.\\nTreatment substances were administered between 0600h and 0800h,\\nimmediately after a first observation session that served to determine\\nthe behavioral baseline. Following injections, behavior was monitored\\nat different intervals, and animals were weighed at the end of each\\nsession. Each test consisted of a 4min exposure to a different\\njuvenile. Social exploration consisted mainly of ano-genital sniffing,\\nface and back grooming and close following. Four conditions were\\ntested: (1) dose-effect relationship of IP IL-lfl: behavior was\\nmonitored 2, 4 and 24 h after treatment; (2) dose--effect relationship\\nof ICV IL-lfl: behavior was monitored 1.5, 3 and 6 h after treatment;\\n(3) blockade of effects induced by ICV IL-lfl by pretreatment with ICV\\nIL-lra: behavior was monitored 1.5, 3 and 6 h after treatment; and (4)\\nblockade of effects induced by IP IL-lfl by pretreatment with ICV IL-\\nlra: behavior was monitored 2, 4 and 6 h after treatment. Body weight\\nwas measured to the nearest. 1 g after the end of the session in each\\ncondition. Surgery and treatment For intracerebroventricular (ICV)\\ninjections, a stainless-steel guide cannula (23-gauge, 7 mm in length)\\nwas implanted unilaterally 1 mm above the lateral ventricle. For this\\nsurgery, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and\\nxylazine (IP injection, 12.2 mg/kg and 1.8 mg/kg, respectively, .1\\nml/10 g body weight) and secured in a Kopf stereotaxic instrument.\\nCoordinates for the guide cannula were .6 mm posterior to bregma, 1.6\\nmm lateral and 2.0 mm below the skull surface at the point of entry\\n(Lehmann, 1974). A 2-week recovery period was allowed before testing.\\nOn the test days, treatment substances were administered by gravity\\nimmediately after the first session using a 30-gauge needle. Following\\nthe injections, behavior was monitored as previously described. At the\\nconclusion of the experiment, correct cannula placement was verified\\nby injecting a solution of India ink into the guide cannula.\\nRecombinant human IL-lfl (rhIL-lfl) (specific activity of 2.5 107\\nU/mg) was provided by Glaxo (Institute of Molecular Biology, Geneva,\\nSwitzerland). IL-lfl injections were given, IP, in 100/~1 apyrogenic\\nsaline at doses of 0 ng, 125 ng, 250 ng and 500 ng/mouse.

ICV IL-l fl depresses social exploration and body weight\\nin a dose- and time-dependent manner The second experiment was\\nconducted to determine the dose-effect relationship of centrally\\ninjected IL-lfl on social exploration in mice (Fig. 2). Immediately\\nafter the first presentation of the juvenile, adult male mice received\\nan injection of saline (n = 5) or IL-lfl at a dose of 100 pg (n = 5),\\n300 pg (n = 4) and 900 pg (n = 5) IL-lfl in a volume of 2/A. A two-way\\nANOVA (treatment x time) on the duration of social exploration\\nrevealed significant effects of the main factors and their interaction\\nIF(3, 15) = 6.2, p < .01; F(3, 45) = 15.9, p < .001; F(9, 45) = 8.0, p\\n< .001, respectively]. Post-hoc comparisons of individual means by the\\nFisher test revealed that ICV injections of 300 and 900 pg of IL-lfl\\ndepressed social investigation 1.5-3 h after treatment, but recovery\\nwas complete by 6 h (Fig. 2a). A two-way ANOVA (treatment x time) on\\nchanges in body weight showed significant effects of the main factors\\nand their interaction [F(3, 15) = 10.6, p < .001; F(2, 30) = 16.6, p <\\n.001; F(6, 30)= 4.2, p < .01, respectively].

The effect of\\nIL-lra on the decrease of social investigation induced by IL-lfl is\\nshown in Fig. 3(a). A three-way ANOVA (IL-lra ILl time) on the\\nduration of social investigation revealed a significant effect of IL-\\nlra [F(1, 13) = 9.2, p < .01], time factor IF(3, 13) = 14.4, p < .001]\\nand the IL-lra IL-1 interaction [F(1, 13) = 9.2, p < .01]; IL-lra time\\ninteraction [F(3, 39) = 3.9, p < .05]; IL-1 time interaction IF(3,\\n39)= 3.0, p < .05]; and IL-lra IL-1 x time interaction [F(3, 39)= 4.4,\\np < .01]. A post-hoc analysis of individual group means by the Fisher\\ntest showed that social exploration had decreased in saline + IL-1\\nmice compared to saline + saline for the entire period of testing, and\\nthat this effect was blocked by pretreatment with IL-lra. Concerning\\nthe change in body weight, a three-way ANOVA (IL-lra IL-1 time)\\nrevealed a significant effect of IL-1 IF(l, 13) = 8.4, p < .05], time\\nfactor [F(2, 26) = 5.0, p < .05], ILIra x IL-1 interaction [F(1,\\n13)=7.2, p < . 0 5 ] and IL-lra x time interaction IF(2, 26) = 6.0, p\\n< .01], but no effect of either IL-lra or IL-1 x time interaction or\\nILIra IL-1 time interaction.

In the case of the repeated injection of IL-lra (2\\n1.8 fig), the second injection of this cytokine was made 5 min before\\nthe second behavioral test (T2).

All injections were given immediately after the first\\ntest session (time 0), and IL-lra was injected first, followed by\\nIL-1/L When two injections of 1.8/~g IL-lra were given, the second\\ninjection was made before the behavioral test session run at T2. The\\neffects of IL-lfl were assessed on the mean duration of social\\ninvestigation measured 2, 4 and 6 h post-injection and expressed as a\\npercentage of baseline values (baseline values: 136.5 s). The change\\nin body weight was calculated (g) 6 h after the first test session and\\naveraged for each experimental group (mean initial body weight: 36.0\\ng). (*p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001 compared to mice injected with\\nIL-I/L)    submitted to three test sessions, which were conducted 2, 4\\nand 6 h later. The effect of IL-lra on the decrease of social\\ninvestigation induced by IL-lfl is shown in Fig. 4a. A one-way ANOVA\\non the duration of social investigation revealed a significant effect\\nof the treatment factor IF(6, 38) = 8.9, p < .001]. A post-hoc\\nanalysis of individual group means by the Fisher test revealed that\\nthe IL-lfl-induced decrease in social exploration was attenuated by\\nIL-lra treatment (Fig. 4a). Concerning the changes in body weight\\nmeasured 6 h later, a one-way A N O V A revealed a significant effect\\nof the treatment factor [F(6, 38) = 12.3, p < .001]. A post-hoc\\nanalysis of individual group means by the Fisher test revealed that\\nthe decrease in body weight, induced by IP IL-1, was attenuated by ICV\\nIL-lra in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4b).    DISCUSSION The present\\nresults show that pretreatment with ICV IL-lra fully blocked the\\neffects of IP IL-lfl on social exploration and, to a lesser extent,\\nthe body weight loss induced by this cytokine. This observation is in\\naccordance with previously obtained results in rats (Bluth6 et al.,\\n1995). IL-lra is able to block the activity of IL-1 in many in-vivo\\nand in-vitro systems (Dinarello & Thompson, 1991; Dinarello, 1996). In\\nspite of the fact that IL-lra has about the same affinity for IL-1\\nreceptors as IL-lfl (Pruitt et al., 1995), inhibition of the\\nbehavioral effect of IL-lfl required a dose of IL-lra that was\\n2000-fold in excess of that of IL-1. This is consistent with the\\nconcentration of IL-lra reported to block the effects of IL-lfl, such\\nas fever (Kent et al., 1992), promotion of non-rapid eye movement\\nsleep in rabbits (Opp &    8    R.-M. Bluth6 et al.    Krueger, 1991),\\ndecreased social exploration in mice and rats (Bluth6 et al., 1991,\\n1995) and inhibition of the short-term food and water intake\\nsuppression in rats (Plata-Salaman & Ffrench-Mullen, 1992). The fact\\nthat IL-lra was able to block the decrease in social exploration\\ninduced by IL-lfl when both molecules were injected ICV, can be\\ninterpreted to suggest that the brain receptors that mediate the\\nbehavioral effects of centrally injected ILlfl are similar to those\\nlocated at the periphery. This identity of central IL-1 receptors with\\nperipheral IL-1 receptors has been confirmed at the protein and mRNA\\nlevels, using immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR techniques in addition to\\nbinding studies (Parnet et al., 1994). The type of IL-1 receptor that\\nmediates the effects of IL-1 in the brain is still unknown. IL-lra\\nbinds to the type I IL-1 receptor with an affinity similar to that of\\nIL-lfl (Dripps et al., 1991a). IL-lra is able to block the binding of\\nIL-lfl to B cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes bearing the type II\\nIL-1 receptor, although this ability is species-specific (Granowitz et\\nal., 1991b). Human IL-lra binds with high affinity to the type I IL-1\\nreceptor present on human and mouse cell lines. However, human IL-lra\\nbinds very poorly to the type II IL-1 receptor on murine pre-B cells\\nand macrophages (Dripps et al., 1991b; Mclntyre et al., 1991). It is\\nlikely, therefore, that the behavioral and metabolic effects of IL-1\\nin the brain are mediated by the type I IL-1 receptor. However,\\nLuheshi et al. (1993) showed that ICV administration of an antibody to\\nthe type II IL-1 receptor inhibited fever and thermogenesis induced by\\nIP injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the active fragment of the\\nendotoxin. The most interesting finding of the present study is that\\nICV IL-lra was able to attenuate the behavioral and metabolic effects\\nof IP IL-lfl. Similar results have already been obtained in rats\\n(Bluth6 et al., 1995; Kent et al., 1992). The present findings attest\\nthe generality of this phenomenon by showing that it is not species-\\nspecific. The more marked activity of ILlra on the effects of IP IL-I~\\non behavior than on its effect on body weight is in line with previous\\nstudies showing that the depressive effect of IP IL-lfl on food-\\nmotivated behavior is only partially attenuated by ICV IL-lra in rats\\n(Kent et al., 1992, 1996). Most of the body weight loss that occurs in\\nmice in response to an IP injection of the cytokine inducer, LPS, is\\nlikely to be due to anorexia since it is mimicked by removal of food\\nfrom the cage of salinetreated animals (Cremona, personal\\ncommunication) and is not accompanied by increased defecation or\\ndiarrhea. Since peripheral administration of the cytokine inducer LPS\\nenhances the expression of IL-I~ in the brain (Gatti & Bartfai, 1993;\\nLay6 et al., 1994), it is likely that the same effect occurs in\\nresponse to peripheral administration of IL-lfl. However, this has not\\nyet been tested. This influence of peripheral immune stimuli on brain\\nIL-1 is mediated by vagal afferents. Section of the vagus nerve\\nattenuated both the decrease in social exploration (Bluth6 et al.,\\n1994, 1996) and the induction of IL-lfl mRNA in the mouse brain in\\nresponse to IP LPS (Lay6 et al., 1995). Vagotomy also blocked fevers\\ncaused by IP injection of IL-lfl (Watkins et al., 1995). The site of\\naction of ICV injected IL-lra in the mouse brain is not yet known and\\nneeds to be specified by micropharmacology experiments. ICV injected\\nIL-lra is unlikely to leak out of the blood-brain barrier in\\nsignificant quantities, but even if it does so, it is important to\\nnote that the doses that are administered ICV are 1000- to 2000-fold\\nless than those necessary to block the effect of IL-lfl when both\\ncytokines are injected at the periphery.    IL-lra Antagonizes\\nBehavioral and Metabolic Effects of IL-1    9    In conclusion, the\\nresults of the present experiments confirm that I L - l r a is able to\\nblock the effect of IL-lfl on behavior and body weight, whether this\\ncytokine is injected at the periphery or in the brain. They also point\\nto a central effect of peripherally administered IL1~ probably via the\\nsynthesis and release of IL-lfl in the brain.
