       "'Approximately 25–40% of patients with lung cancer show bone metastasis. Bone modifying agents reduce skeletal-related events (SREs), but they do not significantly improve overall survival. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches are urgently required. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of TAS-115, a VEGFRs and HGF receptor (MET)-targeted kinase inhibitor, in a tumor-induced bone disease model. A549-Luc-BM1 cells, an osteo-tropic clone of luciferase-transfected A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549-Luc), produced aggressive bone destruction associated with tumor progression after intra-tibial (IT) implantation into mice. TAS-115 significantly reduced IT tumor growth and bone destruction. Histopathological analysis showed a decrease in tumor vessels after TAS-115 treatment, which might be mediated through VEGFRs inhibition. Furthermore, the number of osteoclasts surrounding the tumor was decreased after TAS-115 treatment.  In vitro  studies demonstrated that TAS-115 inhibited HGF-, VEGF-, and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF)-induced signaling pathways in osteoclasts. Moreover, TAS-115 inhibited Feline McDonough Sarcoma oncogene (FMS) kinase, as well as M-CSF and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation. Thus, VEGFRs/MET/FMS-triple inhibition in osteoclasts might contribute to the potent efficacy of TAS-115. The fact that concomitant dosing of sunitinib (VEGFRs/FMS inhibition) with crizotinib (MET inhibition) exerted comparable inhibitory efficacy for bone destruction to TAS-115 also supports this notion. In conclusion, TAS-115 inhibited tumor growth via VEGFR-kinase blockade, and also suppressed bone destruction possibly through VEGFRs/MET/FMS-kinase inhibition, which resulted in potent efficacy of TAS-115 in an A549-Luc-BM1 bone disease model. Thus, TAS-115 shows promise as a novel therapy for lung cancer patients with bone metastasis.\\nHGF-MET and VEGF-VEGFR signaling pathways play important roles in bone metabolism. MET and VEGFR and their ligands, HGF and VEGF, respectively, are expressed in both osteoblasts and osteoclasts [ 6 ]. HGF-MET and VEGF-VEGFR signaling has been reported to engage in bone remodeling by promoting osteoclast differentiation/function and upregulating RANKL in osteoblasts [ 7 ,  8 ]. MET and VEGFR signaling also has pivotal roles in cancer progression and bone metastasis. Higher expression of MET was reported in bone metastasis patients [ 9 ,  10 ]. Plasma concentrations of VEGF were increased in patients with positive bone scans or histologic confirmation of cancer metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes [ 11 ]. VEGF-VEGFR signaling is well-known to play pivotal roles in tumor angiogenesis [ 12 ]. Cabozantinib, a small molecule VEGFRs and MET-targeted kinase inhibitor, has shown improvement in bone pain and reduction in narcotic use in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer [ 13 ,  14 ]. These insights indicate that simultaneous inhibition of the VEGFR- and MET-axis is a reasonable therapeutic strategy for bone metastasis as targets for both tumor growth and abnormal bone metabolism. In addition to VEGFRs/MET signaling, FMS signaling is reported to have pivotal roles not only in bone metabolism but also in cancer bone metastasis. FMS, which was first discovered as the oncogene responsible for Feline McDonough Sarcoma, is a type III receptor tyrosine kinase that binds to the macrophage or monocyte colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF or CSF-1). Signal transduction as a result of that binding promotes the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Overexpression of CSF-1 and/or FMS has been implicated in a number of disease states such as in the growth and metastasis of certain types of cancer, in the promotion of osteoclast proliferation in bone osteolysis, and in many inflammatory disorders [ 15 ].\\nTAS-115 is a potent VEGFRs and MET-targeted kinase inhibitor, and is currently in a phase I study. We previously reported that TAS-115 showed potent anti-tumor efficacy with higher tolerability compared to pre-existing VEGFRs inhibitors [ 16 ]. Herein we identified that TAS-115 is a potent inhibitor of FMS kinase as well as of VEGFRs/MET kinases, and showed its potent anti-tumor efficacy in a tumor-induced bone disease model.\\nFor analysis of the expression and phosphorylation levels of FMS, MET and VEGFR2, MDBMs were cultured with hM-CSF (20000 U/mL) for 4 days (400000 cells/dish in Suspension Culture Dishes (Corning Inc., NY). The phosphorylation levels of FMS and downstream signaling molecules were then analyzed in these MDBMs following incubation for 1 hr with test compounds at the indicated concentration. The phosphorylation of MET or VEGFR2 was analyzed in these MDBMs following stimulation with rhHGF (100 ng/mL, 10 min) or rhVEGF (100 ng/mL, 5 min), respectively. After incubation, the MDBMs were harvested, the cells were lysed and target signaling proteins were detected by immunoblotting. For analysis of VEGFR2 and its phosphorylated form, the lysate was immunoprecipiated with an anti-VEGFR antibody prior to immunoblotting.\\nRecombinant human FMS dephosphorylated with lambda phosphatase (dephospho-rhFMS, N-terminal His-tagged, 538–972 amino acids) was obtained from Carna Biosciences, Inc. (Hyogo, Japan). Enzyme inhibition studies were performed using LANCE ®  Ultra TR-FRET assay technology [ 21 ]. Briefly, 0.03 μg/mL dephospho-rhFMS and 100 nM ULightTM-poly GT (4:1) (PerkinElmer) were mixed and incubated for 40 min at 25°C in 10 μL of reaction mixture containing 100 μM ATP, 15 mM tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris (pH 7.5)), 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM dithiothreitol and various concentrations of the test compound. The reaction was terminated by addition of 5 μL of 120 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), followed by addition of 5 μL of a detection mixture containing 8 nM LANCE ®  Eu-W-1024 labeled anti-phosphotyrosine PT66 antibody (PerkinElmer) in 30 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and 0.2% Tween 20. After incubation for 60 min at room temperature, phosphorylation of the substrate peptide was monitored by measurement of the TR-FRET signal under excitation at 337 nm with the PHERAstar FS microplate reader (BMG LABTECH GmbH, Ortenberg, Germany). By referring to the TR-FRET signals of positive (no inhibitor) and negative (EDTA was added before the reaction was started) control wells, the percent inhibition of each well was calculated and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value was determined using a four-parameter sigmoidal equation. The assay of MET and VEGFR2 kinase activity was performed as described previously [ 16 ].\\nBased on the results of the histological analysis, the effect of TAS-115 on osteoclast differentiation was investigated in  in vitro  studies. RANKL and M-CSF are known to induce the differentiation of bone marrow macrophages into osteoclasts [ 22 ]. Therefore, the inhibitory potency of TAS-115 towards osteoclast differentiation was evaluated by analysis of TRAP activity in cells after RANKL and M-CSF stimulation. TAS-115 dose-dependently suppressed osteoclast differentiation induced by RANKL and M-CSF, and potently inhibited mouse osteoclast formation at a concentration of 0.3 μM ( Fig 5A and 5B ). These data revealed that TAS-115 had the potential to affect RANKL or M-CSF-related signaling pathways in mouse osteoclast formation. Sunitinib also potently inhibited RANKL and M-CSF-induced mouse osteoclast formation at a concentration of 0.1 μM. Crizotinib and cabozantinib markedly affected mouse osteoclast formation at a concentration of 1 μM. We additionally investigated the effect of TAS-115 on cellular FMS signaling in MDBMs. Western blotting indicated that M-CSF induced the phosphorylation of FMS and its downstream signaling pathways in MDBMs ( Fig 6A ). TAS-115 markedly inhibited M-CSF-stimulated phosphorylation of FMS, ERK1/2 and AKT in MDBMs at a concentration greater than 0.03 μM. This inhibition was comparable to that resulting from sunitinib, which was applied as a positive control agent ( Fig 6A ). In contrast, the inhibition by cabozantinib or crizotinib was moderate even at a concentration of 0.3 μM. To confirm the inhibitory activity of TAS-115 towards human FMS, the cellular IC 50  value of TAS-115 against M-CSF-induced FMS phosphorylation in human acute monocytic THP-1 leukemia cells was determined ( S5 Fig ). The IC 50  value of TAS-115 was 0.012 μM, and no species differences were observed between mouse and human in the inhibitory activity of TAS-115 for FMS. In addition to FMS expression, the expression of MET and VEGFR2 was also detected in MDBMs, and these receptors were activated by exogenous rhHGF and rhVEGF, respectively ( Fig 6B ). Both TAS-115 and cabozantinib inhibited the phosphorylation of MET and VEGFR2 at a concentration greater than 0.03 μM. Since the inhibitory effect of TAS-115 against VEGFR2 and MET has already been reported [ 16 ], we here investigated the inhibitory activity of TAS-115 towards FMS kinase activity using recombinant dephospho-FMS kinase. Sunitinib and TAS-115 potently inhibited FMS activity with IC 50  values of 0.0035 μM and 0.015 μM, respectively, while cabozantinib did so more weakly with an IC 50  value of 0.079 μM ( Table 1 ). A549-Luc-BM1 cells did not express human HGF under either  in vitro  or  in vivo  conditions (data not shown). However, we found that both mouse HGF and human VEGF were detectable in A549-Luc-BM1 implanted tibia and that the expression of these growth factors tended to increase with tumor progression in the tibia ( S6 Fig ). Mouse VEGF was not measured, since human VEGF is known to stimulate the proliferation and survival signal in mouse endothelial. Furthermore, A549-Luc-BM1 cells displayed an approximately 3-fold increase in M-CSF expression compared to A549-Luc cells (p<0.01,  S7 Fig ). These results suggested that VEGF, HGF, and M-CSF in the bone lesion activated their respective receptor expressed in osteoclasts, and that TAS-115 blocked the lytic activity and survival of osteoclasts through inhibition of VEGFRs/MET/FMS-related signaling pathways.\\n(A) Effect of TAS-115, cabozantinib, sunitinib, or crizotinib on FMS kinase mediated phosphorylation in MDBMs. MDBMs were cultured for 4 days with M-CSF in plastic dishes. Test compounds were then added at the indicated concentration to the culture media and incubated for 1 hr. Following incubation of MDBMs with hM-CSF and the indicated drugs, cell lysates were then prepared, and analyzed by subsequent Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. (B) Effect of TAS-115 and cabozantinib on ligand induced VEGFR2 and MET phosphorylation in MDBMs. Cell culture and drug treatments were performed as for the experiments with M-CSF. rhHGF (100 ng/mL) or rhVEGF (100 ng/mL) was then added to the culture media, and, following incubation for 10 or 5 min, respectively, cell lysates were prepared. VEGFR2 and its phosphorylated form were detected in MDBMs by Western blotting following immunoprecipitation with an anti-VEGFR antibody. MET and its phosphorylated form were directly detected by Western blotting. Sunitinib and crizotinib were used as positive control agents for VEGFR2 inhibition and MET inhibition, respectively.\\nWe identified that TAS-115 had potent inhibitory activity towards FMS kinase as well as VEGFRs and MET kinase ( Table 1 ). M-CSF/FMS signaling plays a crucial role with RANKL in a canonical pathway for osteoclast formation [ 36 ]. Overexpression of CSF-1 and/or FMS has been implicated in a number of disease states such as in the growth and metastasis of certain types of cancer, in the promotion of osteoclast proliferation in bone osteolysis, and in many inflammatory disorders [ 37 – 39 ]. Hung et al. showed that M-CSF potentiated lung cancer bone metastasis and that CSF-1R (FMS) knockdown in A549 cells reduced bone metastasis in a preclinical model [ 40 ]. Small molecule FMS inhibitors and anti-FMS antibodies have recently been developed for cancer treatment [ 41 ,  42 ]. We showed that A549-Luc-BM1 cells have an approximately 3-fold increase in M-CSF expression compared to the parental cells ( S7 Fig ). In addition, MDBMs expressed FMS, and exogenous M-CSF could activate FMS signaling pathways in MDBMs ( Fig 6A ). Therefore, a M-CSF/FMS signaling pathway is considered to stimulate osteoclast formation and osteolytic function in A549-Luc-BM1-implanted tibiae. Indeed, TAS-115 potently inhibited RANKL- and M-CSF-stimulated mouse osteoclast differentiation ( Fig 5A ). Interestingly, TAS-115 had more potent efficacy than cabozantinib for suppression of bone destruction and decreasing the number of osteoclasts (Figs  3  and  4C ), although both compounds had almost the same inhibitory potency against VEGFRs and MET kinase ( Table 1 ). These results suggested that FMS inhibition by TAS-115 might contribute to its potent anti-osteolytic activity in the tumor-induced bone disease model. Sunitinib, a VEGFRs inhibitor, also inhibited FMS kinase ( Table 1 ), which was in accordance with a previous report [ 43 ]. However, single treatment of sunitinib only partially inhibited bone destruction and partially decreased the number of osteoclasts (Figs  3  and  4C ), suggesting that only inhibition of FMS, or dual inhibition of VEGFRs/FMS, is not sufficient for the suppression of tumor-induced osteoclast formation and it is possible that MET signaling might complement FMS and/or VEGFR signaling in osteoclasts. To support the notion, the combined treatment of sunitinib (VEGFRs/FMS inhibition) with crizotinib (MET inhibition) exerted superior effects on bone destruction and osteoclast formation to single treatment of sunitinib (Figs  3  and  4C ). These results suggest that simultaneous triple blockade of VEGFRs/MET/FMS might be required for more potent suppression of tumor-related osteoclast formation. TAS-115 could achieve simultaneous triple blockade of VEGFRs/MET/FMS by monotherapy.\\nIt has been reported that cabozantinib significantly improves median progression-free survival and time to first SRE, compared with prednisone, suggesting that VEGFRs/MET inhibition impacts on tumor burden in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients with bone metastasis [ 44 ]. These clinical results support the notion that both VEGFRs and MET signaling pathways are clearly involved in bone metastasis progression and that their inhibition is effective against bone metastasis. However, cabozantinib failed to significantly increase overall survival (OS) compared with prednisone in patients with metastatic CRPC in a pivotal phase III study (COMET-1). In that clinical trial, the discontinuation rate and the sequential therapies used after progression of the disease might be reasons for the failure to improve OS in the cabozantinib arm. TAS-115 significantly suppressed tumor growth without affecting body weight both in a previous study [ 16 ] and in the current study. Based on the drug potency achieved by adding FMS inhibition to VEGFRs/MET inhibition, and the good tolerability of TAS-115, we expect that TAS-115 will also exert prominent anti-tumor efficacy against bone metastasis in a clinical setting.\\nIn conclusion, our results clearly demonstrated that TAS-115 markedly inhibited tumor growth via VEGFR-kinase blockade, and also suppressed bone destruction, possibly through VEGFRs/MET/FMS-kinase blockade, which resulted in potent efficacy of TAS-115 in the A549-Luc-BM1 bone disease model. Based on these data, TAS-115 should provide a novel therapy for patients with bone metastasis of lung or other cancer.\\n'"
