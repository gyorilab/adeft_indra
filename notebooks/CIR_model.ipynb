       "'Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which have multipotential differentiation and self-renewal potential, are possible cells for tissue engineering. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) can be produced by MSCs in an inactive form, and the activation of TGFβ1 functions as an important regulator of osteogenic differentiation in MSCs. Recently, studies showed that GARP participated in the activation of latent TGFβ1, but the interaction between GARP and TGFβ1 is still undefined. In our study, we successfully isolated the MSCs from bone marrow of rats, and showed that GARP was detected in bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). During the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, GARP expression was increased over time. To elucidate the interaction between GARP and TGFβ1, we downregulated GARP expression in BMSCs to examine the level of active TGFβ1. We then verified that the downregulation of GARP decreased the secretion of active TGFβ1. Furthermore, osteogenic differentiation experiments, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity analyses and Alizarin Red S staining experiments were performed to evaluate the osteogenic capacity. After the downregulation of GARP, ALP activity and Alizarin Red S staining significantly declined and the osteogenic indicators, ALP, Runx2, and OPN, also decreased, both at the mRNA and protein levels. These results demonstrated that downregulated GARP expression resulted in the reduction of TGFβ1 and the attenuation of osteoblast differentiation of BMSCs in vitro .'"

       "\"Other support for this stabilizing hypothesis comes from studies on the beta-subunit of the rod cyclic nucleotide gated channel (CNG). It has been shown that PRPH2/RDS can bind to the beta subunit of rod CNG, as well as two other non-membrane bound isoforms also coded for by the  Cngb1  gene called glutamic acid rich proteins (GARP1/2) ( Poetsch et\\xa0al., 2001; Ritter et\\xa0al., 2011 ). The interactions between GARP and PRPH2/RDS were found to be strongest when PRPH2/RDS was in disulfide linked oligomers suggesting the larger PRPH2/RDS complexes might mediate this interaction ( Poetsch et\\xa0al., 2001 ). Given the localization of CNGB1 on the plasma membrane, PRPH2/RDS on the disc rim, and GARP1/2 as free cytosolic forms in between, it has been hypothesized that interactions between PRPH2/RDS and GARP could serve as a mechanism by which PRPH2/RDS could regulate the sizing and orientation of the rod discs. In support of this, elimination of GARP in rods causes disorganization in disc sizing and orientation ( Zhang et\\xa0al., 2009 ).\\nWork assessing the localization of PRPH2/RDS complexes in the photoreceptor cells found that the higher-order PRPH2/RDS oligomers likely don't form until after trafficking to the OS ( Chakraborty et\\xa0al., 2008; Poetsch et\\xa0al., 2001 ). Since covalently linked PRPH2/RDS has a higher affinity for GARP than non-covalently linked PRPH2/RDS, the assembly of large PRPH2/RDS oligomers in the OS could potentially play a role in spatially or temporally regulating the RDS/GARP interaction, and thus disc size and orientation. This idea is supported by experiments that utilized GFP chimeric proteins to map the subcellular compartments where RDS/CNGB1/GARP interactions took place and showed that while PRPH2/RDS and CNGB1 interact during trafficking, PRPH2/RDS and GARP only interacted in the OS ( Ritter et\\xa0al., 2011 ).\\nInteractions with GARP are another example of differing roles/function of PRPH2/RDS in rods vs. cones. The cone CNGB subunit does not have a GARP region or free GARP isoforms and PRPH2/RDS does not interact with the cone CNGB channel ( Conley et\\xa0al., 2010a ). The precise role of PRPH2/RDS interactions with other proteins, such as GARP, to OS organization is not clearly established, however the model that these interactions play an important role in OS organization is well-supported. In addition, tetraspanins are frequently organizers of membrane domains that can mediate interactions with signaling molecules and cellular structural components in other tissues, so a role for PRPH2/RDS in similar functions is consistent with its larger superfamily ( Andreu and Yanez-Mo, 2014 ).\\nThe PRPH2/RDS protein is a critical component for normal vision through its role as a structural protein important for the proper formation of both rod and cone photoreceptor cells. While this is clearly established there is still considerable debate about how exactly PRPH2/RDS is able to fulfill its critical functions. A central remaining question is what the relative functions of the various PRPH2/RDS complexes are. When viewed as a whole, the body of work on the PRPH2/RDS protein strongly suggests that the protein is able to play a complex role in OS formation due to variations in binding affinity for other OS proteins and the relative concentration of the various PRPH2/RDS complexes, which each may possess intrinsic membrane curvature/fusion properties. For example, it is hypothetically possible that large PRPH2/RDS homomeric complexes are core structural components responsible for helping mediate and maintain the curvature of the rim region while smaller and intermediate RDS/ROM-1 complexes are responsible for mediating membrane fusion or organizing protein domains with interacting partners such as GARP to stabilize and properly structure the OS. While ample evidence discussed above would suggest that the PRPH2/RDS complexes have some level of distinct functional importance, no current evidence can adequately address what the functional distinctions and overlaps for the PRPH2/RDS complexes are. Further work will be needed to understand the functional discrepancies between the different PRPH2/RDS complexes and how changes to these complexes alter OS biogenesis.\\n\""
