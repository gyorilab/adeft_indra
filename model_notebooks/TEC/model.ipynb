       "(\"Recent findings indicate that the link between PI3K and STAT3 phosphorylation is mediated by TEC family kinases ( Vogt and Hart, 2011 ). LMP2A increases the activation of the TEC family kinase, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) ( Mano, 1999; Merchant and Longnecker, 2001 ), suggesting that this kinase may be the link connecting PI3K activation and STAT3 phosphorylation in LMP2A-expressing cell lines. If LMP2A activates BTK to enhance STAT3 phosphorylation, then a BTK inhibitor would block the LMP2A-mediated increase in STAT3 phosphorylation. To test this possibility, LMP2A-negative and –positive B cell lines were exposed to the BTK inhibitor, Ibrutinib, for 24 h and STAT3 phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blot analysis. As shown in  Fig. 3 A, the addition of Ibrutinib blocked the LMP2A-dependent phosphorylation of STAT3, without decreasing STAT3 phosphorylation in non-LMP2A-expressing cells. Furthermore, since Ibrutinib decreased STAT3 phosphorylation in LMP2A-expressing cells, we would expect that the addition of Ibrutinib would significantly inhibit the LMP2A-dependent increase in IL-10 production. As shown in  Fig. 3 B, the addition of Ibrutinib decreased IL-10 production in LMP2A-expressing cells in a concentration-dependent manner, further confirming that LMP2A activates the PI3K/BTK/STAT3 pathway to increase IL-10 production in LMP2A-expressing B cells.\\n\",\n",

       "'Apoptosis is a key mechanism for enhanced cellular radiosensitivity in radiation therapy. Studies suggest that Akt signaling may play a role in apoptosis and radioresistance. This study evaluates the possible modulating role of amiloride, an antihypertensive agent with a modulating effect to alternative splicing for regulating apoptosis, in the antiproliferative effects induced by ionizing radiation (IR) in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) 8401 cells. Analysis of cell viability showed that amiloride treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation in irradiated GBM8401 cells (p<0.05) in a time-dependent manner, especially in cells treated with amiloride with IR post-treatment. In comparison with GBM8401 cells treated with amiloride alone, with GBM8401 cells treated with IR alone, and with human embryonic lung fibroblast control cells (HEL 299), GBM8401 cells treated with IR combined with amiloride showed increased overexpression of phosphorylated Akt, regardless of whether IR treatment was performed before or after amiloride administration. The alternative splicing pattern of apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (APAF1) in cells treated with amiloride alone, IR alone, and combined amiloride-IR treatments showed more consistent cell proliferation compared to that in other apoptosis-related genes such as baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5 (BIRC5), Bcl-X, and homeodomain interacting protein kinase-3 (HIPK3). In GBM8401 cells treated with amiloride with IR post-treatment, the ratio of prosurvival (-XL,-LC) to proapoptotic (-LN,-S) splice variants of APAF1 was lower than that seen in cells treated with amiloride with IR pretreatment, suggesting that proapoptotic splice variants of APAF1 (APAF1-LN,-S) were higher in the glioblastoma cells treated with amiloride with IR post-treatment, as compared to glioblastoma cells and fibroblast control cells that had received other treatments. Together, these results suggest that amiloride modulates cell radiosensitivity involving the Akt phosphorylation and the alternative splicing of APAF1, especially for the cells treated with amiloride with IR post-treatment. Therefore, amiloride may improve the effectiveness of radiation therapy for GBMs. \\n'"

       "   'abstract'): 'The aim of this paper is to evaluate whether pulse pressure is an independent risk factor for coronary and stroke mortality in 3282 subjects (1281 males and 2001 females) aged +/- 65 years, taking part in the CArdiovascular STudy in the Elderly (CASTEL). After dividing subjects into tertiles of pulse pressure, adjusted relative risk (RR) and confidence intervals (CI) for 14-year coronary and stroke mortality was evaluated for each tertile. Among females, coronary mortality rate was 2.7% in the first tertile of pulse pressure, 4.7% in the second (RR 1.38, 95% CI [1.15-2.66]) and 6.2% in the third (RR 2, CI [1.20-3.51]). Stroke mortality was 3.6%, 4.1% (RR 1.23, CI [1.02-2.23]) and 8.3% (RR 2.27, CI [1.37-3.74]), respectively. This trend was recognizable in normotensive, borderline and sustained hypertensive women, where mortality increased with rising pulse pressure. No relationship was found between pulse pressure and mortality in males. In elderly women, pulse pressure was a good predictor of coronary and stroke mortality, even superior to the label of hypertension. No matter how any given pulse pressure level was obtained, it was more predictive of both coronary and cerebrovascular mortality than belonging to a normo- or hypertensive category.'})"
