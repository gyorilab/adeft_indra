       "dict_values(['In mammals, peroxidases have some organ, tissue, cellular and sub-cellular specific distribution patterns, performing some specific functions. These peroxidases include, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), uterine peroxidase, lactoperoxidase (LPO), salivary peroxidase (SPO) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) (Klebanoff, 2005). These peroxidases play an important role in wide metabolic activities and are directly or indirectly involved in various diseases (Cheng et al., 2008).\\nDifferent harmful microorganisms enter the human body through the oral passage regularly. These bacteria are killed by the first line of defence system present in saliva, which includes salivary peroxidase (SPO) as the major peroxidase. Oral peroxidases OPO are composed of salivary peroxidase (80%) and MPO (20%) (Pruitt et al., 1990; Nagler et al., 2002). SPO inhibits both Gram-positive and Gram-negative oral and non-oral bacteria. In addition to this, SPO shows antiviral (Yamamoto et al., 1991; Chase & Klebanove, 1992; Mikola et al., 1995), and antifungal (MacCarthy & Dahl, 1989; Lenander-Lumikari, 1992) activities.\\n', '\\n                         Fig. 6A \\n                          depicts the competition curves between unlabelled steroid and [ 3 H]ALDO. The relative affinity obtained for each steroid is (EC 50  values in nM are given in parentheses): ALDO (2.3±0.3)=DOC (2.8±0.6)=CORT (3.1±0.6)>SC9420-spironolactone (SPO) (9.1±3.5)=PROG (15.1±7)>11-OP (43.2±3.0)≫6-OP and testosterone (T=O) (no significant binding).  Fig. 6B  depicts the dose–response curves for the steroids as urinary Na + /K +  ratio. Due to the combined protective action of several factors such as the activity of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  [10] , binding to transcortin and other plasma proteins  [38] , and/or the putative selectivity of the MR itself  [39] , the in vivo biological effect of CORT is impaired in spite of its high affinity for MR in the absence of those regulatory factors, as it is well known. Interestingly, the affinity of 11-OP is about 20-fold lower than the affinity of DOC for the MR, but the in vivo effect of 11-OP is as potent as that exhibited by DOC at low doses and even approaches that of ALDO at doses ≥10 μg. These observations confirm our previous reports  [27,31] . On the other hand, the antagonist steroids PROG and SPO, and the inactive steroids 6-OP and testosterone are very weak mineralocorticoids, if they are not totally inactive. It is interesting to emphasise that the maximum activity of 11-OP in transcription assays is as efficient as that measured for ALDO, CORT, cortisol and DOC (data not shown).\\nThe bar graph in  Fig. 6C  shows that ∼40% of the maximum mineralocorticoid effect can be measured using a suboptimal dose of 0.06 μg of ALDO. As expected, this effect was totally abolished by co-treatment with SPO and partially inhibited by co-treatment with PROG. Importantly, as low a dose of 11-OP as 0.6 ng, which is per se ineffective to promote any biological effect, potentiated the effect of 0.06 μg of ALDO, so that the maximal mineralocorticoid effect was reached. On the other hand, the inactive stereoisomer 6-OP does not affect the ALDO-dependent response.\\n\\n                         Fig. 7A \\n                          shows that the steroid binding capacity of cross-linked MR preincubated with vehicle (EtOH) was inhibited by further alkylation with PLP as compared to untreated control. The protective effect of the ligand on the PLP-dependent inactivation of cross-linked MR could be evidenced not only for ALDO, but also for DOC and CORT. On the other hand, when MR was prebound to the antagonists PROG and SPO, as well as the inactive ligands T=O and 6-OP, no protection was evidenced upon treatment with PLP followed by rebinding of [ 3 H]ALDO. Interestingly, the synthetic agonist 11-OP was also incapable of protecting the MR, demonstrating that the binding of 11-OP to the MR exhibits different properties with respect to natural agonists. It should be noted that identical results (not shown) were also obtained with TNBS-treated MR.\\n\\n                         Fig. 7B  depicts the MR inactivation rate upon treatment with PLP at different pH values. As shown in  Fig. 2C  for kidney cytosol, the maximal inactivation of unliganded receptor is reached at pH ≥9.0, suggesting the blockade of an ϵ-amino group. Similarly, steroids that do not exhibit binding properties to the MR such as testosterone and 6-OP were incapable of affecting the inactivation rate of the MR which is indistinguishable from the control. In contrast, the physiological agonists ALDO, DOC and CORT protected the MR from inactivation in the full range of pH values. Consistent with the notion that the binding of 11-OP to the MR is not equivalent to the binding of natural agonists, the synthetic agonist 11-OP shows a similar function as the inactive steroids at pH ≤8.0, but a partial protective action at higher pH values. Such an effect is clearly different from the observations obtained with both natural agonists and inactive steroids. Interestingly, a similar effect as that of 11-OP can be described for SPO and PROG, antagonistic steroids whose rate constants of inhibition are not distinguishable from the  K \\n                         i  obtained with 11-OP in the complete range of pH values assayed.\\nTaken together, these results demonstrate that the binding of natural agonists to the MR is comparable to neither the binding observed for 11-OP nor the binding of the antagonists SPO and PROG. Remarkably, 11-OP is not an antagonist, but an agonist that not only possesses mineralocorticoid effects per se but is also able to potentiate the ALDO biological effect.\\nThe rat MR possesses a total of 53 Lys residues, 18 of which are localised in the steroid binding domain  [40] . This led us to postulate that some lysyl groups may be essential for the binding of steroid to the MR. In this work, we provide evidence that this may be the case due to the substantial inhibition of hormone binding to MR upon modification of amino groups with PLP and TNBS. According to the data obtained in the experiment shown in  Fig. 5 , a stoichiometry equal to one Lys residue per molecule of receptor accounts for about a 70% inhibition of steroid binding. This suggests a critical role for only one lysyl group in the MR among those 53 total residues. Regardless of the exact location and number of residues modified by the treatment of the MR, the importance of this observation is that such inhibition is prevented if a natural agonist (i.e. ALDO, DOC or CORT) is bound to the receptor, but it is not protected upon antagonist binding (i.e. PROG or SPO). In this sense, the synthetic agonist 11-OP remarkably resembles the properties of antagonistic compounds rather than natural agonistic steroids ( Fig. 7 ).\\nWe have previously postulated that the synthetic steroid 11-OP may exert its biological effect by binding to an alternative site on the MR  [37] . Other possible biopharmacological properties that can account for 11-OP’s biological effect were studied and ruled out in a previous work  [27]  (i.e. a longer in vivo half-life, stronger in vivo binding to renal MR, non-genomic effects, etc.). In spite of the potent biological action of 11-OP, its protective effect against inactivation by PLP at high pH is just partial and closer to that observed with PROG and SPO ( Fig. 7B ). Again, this supports the notion that only agonists bound to the ALDO binding pocket with an appropriate orientation of the molecule are capable of fully protecting the amino group(s) from alkylating agents. A reasonable explanation for the differential protective effect observed with different ligands is the putative differential orientation of the ligand in the steroid binding pocket or its binding to a completely different binding site. Accordingly, a recent publication by Geller et al.  [44]  described cases of hypertension and pregnancy-related hypertension by a substitution of Leu 810  by Ser in the hMR. This substitution alters receptor specificity, where PROG, SPO and other 21-deoxysteroids become mineralocorticoids. Moreover, Auzou et al.  [45]  have reported that a mutant of hMR in Ala 773  also confers 11β-substituted spirolactones agonistic properties. Both mutations, Leu 810  and Ala 773 , are localised in the hormone binding domain of the MR.\\nIn this work, we also present evidence that a partial agonist/antagonist like PROG and an antagonist like SPO were incapable of protecting the MR at physiological pH, and only a partially protective effect was detected at alkaline pH for both compounds. The actual mechanism of action for SPO is still controversial. It was initially thought that SPO competitively inhibits ALDO binding to the MR and prevents its translocation to the nucleus  [46] . However, it was shown that SPO translocates into the nucleus associated to MR  [47]  and can bind to the DNA in vitro  [48] . Both processes seem to be less efficient than for ALDO. Recently, a cell-dependent partial agonistic activity of SPO was also reported  [49] . One possible explanation for these features may also be found in a differential positioning of SPO in the MR. Our results may be explained by a similar argument. In effect, even when SPO was present at saturating concentrations, only a minimal protective effect against the treatment with PLP could be evidenced, suggesting that the steroid can be placed in the ligand binding pocket, but has a different orientation of the steroid frame and/or functional groups. Therefore, modified lysyl groups required for ALDO binding remain exposed and, consequently, unprotected.\\n', 'Whereas many of the laboratory yeast strains sporulate poorly, the sporulation-proficient strain background SK1 can undergo premeiotic DNA replication and meiosis division with a certain degree of synchrony (Cha et al. 2000; Stuart 2008). Nevertheless, to study specific stages of sporulation or meiosis, a highly synchronous cell population is desirable, which led to the development of different strategies to further improve the synchrony of sporulation (Wan et al. 2006; Carlile and Amon 2008; Berchowitz et al. 2013). Previous work showed that expressing IME1 together with IME4 from the inducible CUP1 promoter (CUP-IME1 and CUP-IME4) drives cells to undergo gametogenesis more synchronously compared to wild-type SK1 (Berchowitz et al. 2013). For this procedure, cells were grown in rich medium (YPD) until saturation, shifted to presporulation medium (BYTA), then transferred to sporulation medium (SPO). Subsequently, cells were incubated in SPO for 2\\xa0hr before IME1 and IME4 were induced with copper (II) sulfate. We speculated that the timing of IME1 and IME4 induction in SPO could be an important factor in regulating sporulation, since the expression of these genes are tightly regulated (Chu et al. 1998; Primig et al. 2000; van Werven and Amon 2011). To examine this, we expressed IME1 and IME4 at different times, and quantified the percentage of cells that completed meiotic divisions for a series of time points (Figure 1A). From these data, we estimated the synchrony of meiotic divisions by computing the time or period taken for 75% of the cells to complete meiotic divisions (see Materials and Methods for details) (Figure 1, A and B). The shorter the time or period, the more synchronous the meiotic divisions. We also conducted a one-way ANOVA and a post hoc Tukey’s test to compare the effect of expressing IME1 and IME4 at different times on the period taken to complete meiotic divisions. The ANOVA showed that the effect of expressing IME1 and IME4 at different times was statistically significant, F(5,12)\\xa0=\\xa03.82, P\\xa0=\\xa00.0265. We observed an improvement in the synchrony of meiotic divisions significantly when IME1 and IME4 were induced at 2\\xa0hr after shifting to SPO instead of at 0\\xa0hr (4.19\\xa0hr compared to 2.21\\xa0hr, P\\xa0=\\xa00.0112) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, inducing IME1 and IME4 either earlier or later resulted did not improve the synchrony significantly (P\\xa0>\\xa00.05), suggesting that there is an optimal period to induce the two master regulators. The differences in kinetics cannot be explained by Ime1 and Ime4 protein levels since they were comparable between the different samples (Figure 1C). In conclusion, our result shows that the timing of IME1 and IME4 induction in sporulation medium contributes to synchronous meiotic divisions.\\nSynchronous sporulation requires specific timing of IME1 and IME4 induction. (A) Kinetics of meiotic divisions in diploid cells harboring CUP1 promoter fusions with IME1 and IME4 (pCUP-IME1/pCUP-IME4) (FW1810). Cells were grown overnight in rich medium (YPD), diluted to presporulation medium (BYTA), and grown for another 16\\xa0hr. Subsequently cells were transferred to sporulation medium (SPO), and IME1 and IME4 were induced at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6\\xa0hr in SPO. Samples were collected at 4\\xa0hr after induction up to 12\\xa0hr with a 1-hr interval, fixed in ethanol, nuclei were stained with DAPI, and DAPI masses were counted. Cells that harbored two, three, or four DAPI masses were classified as cells undergoing meiosis\\xa0I or meiosis\\xa0II (% MI\\xa0+\\xa0MII, y-axis). For each time point, at least 200 cells were counted. The time after IME1/IME4 induction is plotted on the x-axis. From each time course experiment, we also computed the time or period taken for 75% of the cells to complete meiotic divisions (see Materials and Methods for details). This number is displayed in brackets next to the legend, and represents the mean number of hours from three independent experiments followed by the SEM. (B) Graph to illustrate how we determined the time or period taken to complete meiotic divisions when IME1 and IME4 were induced at 0 or 2\\xa0hr after shifting cells to SPO medium as described in (A). A linear trend line was fitted from the first time point where meiotic divisions were detected, to the time point where 75% or more of the cells completed meiotic divisions. From the function, we calculated the period or time taken for 75% of the cells to complete meiotic divisions (MI/II). (C) Western blot showing Ime1 and Ime4 protein levels in cells described in (A). Samples were taken at 2\\xa0hr after inducing IME1 and IME4. Ime1 and Ime4 levels were detected by anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies. We also measured Ime1 and Ime4 in an untagged control (FW1511), and in cells that contain HA-tagged IME1 (FW2444), or IME4 (FW2480) alone. To control for loading, Hxk1 levels were also determined.\\nEfficient IME1 transcription requires glucose and nitrogen starvation, and the presence of a nonfermentable carbon source in the growth medium (Kassir et al. 1988). To obtain high levels of IME1 in SPO, cells are usually pregrown in acetate-containing medium. In contrast, induction of transcription from the CUP1 promoter requires solely the presence of copper ions in the medium. If variability in the onset of meiotic divisions is dependent largely on IME1 and IME4 levels, then pregrowth in acetate-containing medium should be dispensable when entry into sporulation is induced from the CUP1 promoter. Hence, we tested if the pCUP-IME1/pCUP-IME4 system can induce gametogenesis synchronously when cells were pregrown in glucose containing medium (YPD), and shifted to SPO directly (Figure 2A). To ensure that all cells were arrested as unbudded cells, we grew cells in YPD with reduced glucose (1% w/v instead of 2% w/v) for 16–18\\xa0hr. Whereas the majority of cells were budding when grown in medium with standard glucose levels, the reduced glucose condition enriched for unbudded cells (∼90%) after an overnight culture (Figure 2B). Cells pregrown in YPD or BYTA also gave rise to viable spores (Figure 2C). Next, we shifted cells to SPO medium, incubated cells for 2\\xa0hr, subsequently induced IME1 and IME4 with copper (II) sulfate, and measured the kinetics of meiotic S-phase and meiotic divisions. We observed that cells pregrown in BYTA or YPD both completed premeiotic DNA replication in ∼60\\xa0min (Figure 2D). Remarkably, in the YPD to SPO condition, the DNA profile showed intermediate peaks for several time points (between 2C and 4C) indicating that the population of cells underwent DNA replication with a high degree of synchrony (Figure 2D). When the cells were pregrown in BYTA, these intermediate peaks were less pronounced. In addition, we also measured the rate of meiotic divisions, and found the majority of cells completed meiotic divisions within comparable periods in both conditions (Figure 2E). We conducted a two-tailed t-test, and found that the time taken to complete meiotic divisions under both conditions was not statistically significantly different (P\\xa0>\\xa00.05). Overall, our results show that synchronous DNA replication and meiotic divisions can be induced from cells precultured until saturation in nutrient-rich medium containing glucose.\\nCells do not require growth in acetate-containing medium prior to induction of synchronous sporulation. (A) Flowchart for inducing synchronous sporulation. Diploid pCUP-IME1/pCUP-IME4 (FW1810) cells were grown to exponential phase for 6–7\\xa0hr in YPD. Cells were subsequently diluted to YPD medium with 1% glucose and grown for 16–18\\xa0hr to an OD600 of 11–12 to obtain mostly unbudded G1 cells. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, washed with sterile water and resuspended to a final OD600 of 2.5 in SPO; 50\\xa0µM copper\\xa0(II) sulfate was added 2\\xa0hr after the cells were transferred to SPO to induce IME1 and IME4. (B) Budding index of cells cultured for 16\\xa0hr in YPD with different glucose concentrations. The mean and SEM from three independent experiments is shown, and n\\xa0=\\xa0400 cells were counted for each repeat. (C) Spore viability of the pCUP-IME1/pCUP-IME4 strain. Cells were grown overnight in YPD, and induced to sporulate in SPO after transfer from YPD or presporulation media (BYTA). Sporulation was induced using standard protocols (BYTA to SPO), or by using the method described in (A) (YPD to SPO). Copper\\xa0(II) sulfate was added 2\\xa0hr after the cells were transferred to SPO. Tetrads were collected 24\\xa0hr after IME1 induction, dissected, and assayed for viability (n\\xa0=\\xa0160 spores). The mean value of three independent experiments plus the SEM is shown. (D) Flow cytometry analysis of DNA content of cells cultured in either reduced glucose YPD or presporulation medium (BYTA) before shifting to SPO. Samples were taken at indicated time points, fixed, and DNA content was measured by propidium iodide staining. At least 50,000 cells were analyzed at each time point. (E) Kinetics of meiotic divisions in cells as described in (C) and (D). For determining the kinetics of meiotic divisions, samples were taken at the indicated time point, fixed, and DAPI masses were counted.

(F) Kinetics of meiotic divisions of the pCUP-IME1/pCUP-IME4 strain as described (A) and (E), except that sporulation was induced in either regular SPO or supplemented SPO (see Materials and Methods). The graph displays a representative experiment from three repeated experiments. *, time of induction of IME1, 2\\xa0hr after the cells were transferred to SPO.\\nWe also examined whether the composition of SPO medium influences the synchrony of meiotic divisions of cells pregrown in YPD. To do so, we increased the level of acetate in SPO from 0.3 to 1.0% w/v, and the medium was supplemented with amino acids and adenine (see Materials and Methods for details). Cells started meiotic divisions slightly earlier when using the supplemented SPO instead of the regular SPO (Figure 2F). Hence, we decided to use the supplemented SPO for the experiments described in the remainder of the manuscript.\\nInduction of IME1 is sufficient to induce gametogenesis synchronously. (A) Kinetics of meiotic divisions in wild-type cells (FW1511), cells harboring IME1 and IME4 fused to the CUP1 promoter (pCUP-IME1/pCUP-IME4) (FW1810), pCUP-IME1 (FW2444), or pCUP-IME4 (FW2480). Cells were grown overnight in YPD, and shifted to SPO (1.0% w/v potassium acetate supplemented with adenine, uracil, and amino acids); 50\\xa0µM copper\\xa0(II) sulfate was added 2\\xa0hr after the cells were transferred to SPO.

We hypothesized that IME1 directly or indirectly regulates IME4 expression. To examine this possibility, we measured IME4 transcript levels in cells harboring pCUP-IME1 in the presence or absence of copper (II) sulfate. As expected, IME1 transcript levels increased when copper ions were added to the SPO medium (Figure 4A). Since IME4 is also regulated by an antisense transcript, we specifically quantified IME4 sense mRNA using a transcript-specific primer in the reverse transcription reaction (Hongay et al. 2006; Gelfand et al. 2011). We found that IME4 transcript levels significantly increased when IME1 was induced, suggesting that Ime1 stimulates IME4 transcription (Figure 4B). Data from a genome-wide study indicated that IME4 is regulated directly by the repressor Ume6 (Williams et al. 2002). During early sporulation, Ime1 interacts with Ume6 to form a transcription-activating complex for the expression of early meiotic genes (Bowdish et al. 1995; Rubin-Bejerano et al. 1996). To test whether Ume6 indeed binds the IME4 promoter, we identified the canonical URS1 motif (TAGGCGGC) sequence at −234 bp upstream in the IME4 promoter. More importantly, we found that Ume6 was bound directly to the IME4 promoter, as shown by ChIP (Figure 4C). In conclusion, our results show that IME1 directly regulates the expression of IME4, explaining why IME1 can single-handedly induce synchronous sporulation. These results also suggest that IME1 and IME4 act in a positive feedback loop to stimulate the expression of each other.\\nIME1 directly regulates the expression of IME4. (A) Induction of IME1 promotes IME4 expression. Diploid cells harboring pCUP-IME1 (FW2444) were transferred to SPO. Cells were either untreated (control) or treated with copper\\xa0(II) sulfate (induced), and samples were collected at different time points. Total RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, and IME1 (left panel) or IME4 (right panel) mRNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR. To quantify IME4 levels, primers specific for the IME4 and ACT1 sense strand were used in the reverse transcription reaction. Signals were normalized to ACT1 levels. The values and error bars represent two independent experiments. (B) Ume6 binds to the promoter of IME4. Diploid cells harboring Ume6 tagged with the V5 epitope (FW1208) and a wild-type control strain (FW1511) were grown in YPD to saturation. Cells were fixed with formaldehyde, and cells were processed for ChIP analyses (see Materials and Methods for details). DNA fragments specific to the IME4 promoter (pIME4) were amplified and quantified by qPCR. Signals were normalized to the HMR locus. The error bars represent the SE of at least three experiments. *, time of induction of IME1—2 hr after the cells were transferred to SPO.\\nDifferent genetic approaches have been used to synchronize cells at different stages of sporulation (Benjamin et al. 2003; Wan et al. 2006; Carlile and Amon 2008). One approach makes use of controlled expression of the transcription factor NDT80, and, as a result, cells undergo meiotic divisions synchronously (Benjamin et al. 2003; Carlile and Amon 2008). The Ndt80 transcription factor promotes the expression of numerous genes that regulate meiotic divisions, also known as middle genes (Xu et al. 1995; Chu et al. 1998). Effective induction of NDT80 is achieved by controlling its expression from the GAL1 promoter (pGAL-NDT80) and the transcription factor GAL4-ER, consisting of the Gal4 DNA binding domain fused to the estrogen receptor binding domain. In the presence of β-estradiol, pGAL-NDT80 cells induce NDT80, and exit from pachytene arrest to undergo meiotic divisions (Benjamin et al. 2003; Carlile and Amon 2008). The pGAL-NDT80 system specifically synchronizes meiotic divisions during gametogenesis, but, unlike the pCUP-IME1 system, this method does not synchronize the events prior to meiotic chromosome segregation. To examine whether it is possible to combine the pCUP-IME1 system with the pGAL-NDT80 system, we generated a diploid strain with both synchronization systems. The early and middle stages of sporulation were initiated by IME1 at 2\\xa0hr, and NDT80 at 6\\xa0hr, after shifting cells to SPO, respectively (Figure 5A). We found that the pCUP-IME1 and pGAL-NDT80 cells had a similar degree of synchrony of meiotic divisions (Figure 5B). The pCUP-IME1/pGAL-NDT80 strain showed a minor improvement in synchrony, which was not statistically significant (P\\xa0>\\xa00.05), when compared to cells expressing pCUP-IME1 or pGAL-NDT80 alone (1.18\\xa0hr compared to 1.63 and 1.63\\xa0hr) (Figure 5B). We observed a similar trend when we examined meiosis\\xa0I and meiosis\\xa0II divisions separately, showing that the pCUP-IME1 or pGAL-NDT80 systems can be combined (Figure 5C). With the pCUP-IME1/pGAL-NDT80 system, we can synchronize cells at the level of premeiotic DNA replication until completion of meiotic divisions, with the added advantage of being able to control entry into the early and middle stages of gametogenesis.\\npCUP-IME1 system can be combined with the pGAL-NDT80 system to improve synchrony of sporulation. (A) Scheme of experimental setup. The diploid cells harboring IME1 fused to CUP promoter (FW2444), NDT80 expressed from the GAL promoter together with Gal4 fused to the estrogen receptor (GAL4.ER pGAL-NDT80) (FW1541) or a strain expressing both (pCUP-IME1 and GAL4.ER pGAL-NDT80) (FW2795) were grown in YPD overnight. Cells harboring GAL4.ER GAL-NDT80 (FW1541) were transferred to presporulation medium (BYTA). Subsequently, cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with sterile water and resuspended to a final OD600 of 2.5 in SPO; 50\\xa0µM copper\\xa0(II) sulfate was added 2\\xa0hr after the cells were transferred to SPO, and 1\\xa0µM β-estradiol was added 6\\xa0hr after transfer to SPO. (B) Kinetics of meiotic divisions in strains, using procedures described in (A). Samples were taken at the indicated time points, fixed in ethanol, nuclei were stained with DAPI, and DAPI masses were counted. Cells that harbored two, three, or four DAPI masses were classified as cells undergoing meiosis\\xa0I or meiosis\\xa0II (% MI\\xa0+\\xa0MII). For each time point, at least 200 cells were counted. We also computed the time or period taken for 75% of the cells to complete meiotic divisions (see Materials and Methods for details). This number is displayed in brackets next to the legend, and represents the mean number of hours followed by the SEM of three independent experiments. (C) Similar to B except that the percentages of bi- (left panel), or tri- and tetra-nucleate (right panel) cells (n\\xa0=\\xa0200 cells) of strains described in (A) were determined. *, time of IME1 induction; **, time of NDT80 induction.\\nOur data indicate that induction of synchronous sporulation requires a specified timing of IME1 induction. Interestingly, in wild-type cells, the IME1 promoter, like in synchronous sporulation, is active at 2\\xa0hr after shifting to sporulation medium (Inai et al. 2007; Nachman et al. 2007). Given that nutrient availability is an important trigger for IME1 and sporulation, perhaps nutrients also control timing of sporulation after IME1 induction (Jambhekar and Amon 2008; van Werven and Amon 2011) . Inducing IME1 too late could affect sporulation, because cells have been starved for prolonged times, whereas inducing IME1 too early does not result in optimal sporulation because cells are not ready. In line with this hypothesis, in a recent report we showed that a certain level of nutrient-sensing target of rapamycin complex (TORC1) activity is needed for sporulation (Weidberg et al. 2016). Too much or too little TORC1 affects sporulation negatively. Perhaps, TORC1 activity is most optimal for synchronous sporulation at 2\\xa0hr in SPO. Another explanation is that downstream targets of IME1 are not properly activated because the meiosis promoting kinases Rim11 and Rim15 are not active (Bowdish et al. 1994; Rubin-Bejerano et al. 1996; Vidan and Mitchell 1997; Pedruzzi et al. 2003; Sarkar et al. 2014). This can explain why inducing IME1 too early did not result in synchronous sporulation, but cannot explain the reduced synchrony when IME1 is induced too late. More work is needed to pinpoint why timing of IME1 expression is critical for synchronous sporulation.\\n', 'Mossy fiber boutons are also selectively marked by the presynaptic vesicle-associated protein synaptoporin (SPO; also called synaptophysin 2) (Singec et al., 2002). We found that TTX markedly increased SPO immunoreactivity along proximal but not distal dendrites (Figure 5C–D) (proximal: NT 1.0±0.37, TTX 4.0±1.2, P<0.05; distal: NT 0.34±0.12, TTX 0.62±0.19, P=0.24). The TTX-induced proximal cluster synapses labeled with PSD-95 were apposed to particularly large puncta immunoreactive for SPO (Figure 5C, insets), indicating that inactivity promotes presynaptic MF elaboration opposite proximal TE expansion in CA3 cells.\\nWe hypothesized that the increase in AMPAR-mEPSC frequency after TTX treatment was due to selective upregulation of MF-CA3 synapses. We therefore performed a synaptotagmin uptake assay to determine presynaptic release at SPO-positive terminals. While TTX treatment again increased proximal SPO levels (Figure S5A–B), inactivity did not significantly increase either proximal or distal synaptotagmin levels (TTX proximal: 131.7±17.9% of NT proximal; TTX distal: 41.8±4.8% of NT distal; Figure S5A,C). However, TTX treatment caused a massive redistribution of synaptotagmin to SPO-positive boutons (NT proximal: 31.8±5.3% synaptotagmin colocalization with SPO, TTX proximal: 80.9±3.7%; NT distal: 16.6±4.4%, TTX distal: 52.0±8.7%; P<0.01; Figure S5A,D), suggesting that inactivity reallocates presynaptic efficacy towards MF-CA3 synapses as has been observed in organotypic slice culture (Kim and Tsien, 2008; Mitra et al., 2012).\\nHippocampal MF synapses are the most powerful hippocampal synapses known (Henze et al., 1997; Jonas et al., 1993), making it possible that the inactivity-induced increase in AMPAR-mEPSC amplitude was due to selective increases in presynaptic release from these terminals. We therefore quantified the number of large amplitude mEPSCs (>95th percentile amplitude value for control neurons, 20 pA) recorded before and after mGluR2 activation, which is known to block MF transmission in acute slice (Mellor and Nicoll, 2001). Using the synaptotagmin uptake assay to validate the in vitro MF blockade, we found that acute mGluR2 agonist application decreased the colocalization of synaptotagmin with SPO in both proximal and distal dendrites (Figure S5D). Acute MF blockade with mGluR2 agonists LY487379 (5 µM) or DCGIV (10 µM, data not shown) significantly decreased the number of large amplitude mEPSCs observed in TTX-treated neurons (events/minute: baseline, 58.2±21.8; LY487379, 23.5±11.8, P=0.032, paired t-test vs. baseline), without altering the number of small amplitude events (<20 pA) (Figure 5E–F, S5E). MF blockade also abolished the significant differences in mEPSC amplitude observed with homeostatic adaptation (in pA, baseline: NT 8.5±0.92, TTX 11.5±1.0, PTX 6.1±0.52; P<0.01, one-way ANOVA; LY487379: NT 8.1±0.86, TTX 10.0±0.67, PTX 6.9±1.2; P=0.08) (Figure 5G), suggesting that changes in MF transmission largely account for the observed homeostatic changes in amplitude.\\nTo confirm that SPO-positive MF terminals innervate CA3 neurons in vitro, we immunostained GFP-transfected neurons with PSD-95 and the CA3-specific marker, Py. SPO-positive boutons from GFP-transfected DG neurons preferentially targeted Py-positive CA3 cells (~80 %; Figure S6A–B), reflecting a high specificity of DG-CA3 synaptic connections in culture.\\nTo test the requirement of MF upregulation for inactivity-induced TE formation, we used RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of SPO (validated in Figure S6C–E). Neurons were transfected with control vector (pLL3.7), SPO-shRNA, or SPO-shRNA with an RNAi-insensitive SPO rescue construct for 2 days before 24 hr of TTX treatment. MF axonal processes from GFP-expressing DG neurons were traced to identify the postsynaptic contacts of SPO-positive terminals (Figure 6A, Figure S6A–B, F). Following TTX treatment, MF boutons (circles in Figure 6A) contacted the large PSD-95 immunoreactive puncta in proximal CA3 dendrites. SPO knockdown in presynaptic MF terminals abolished TTX-mediated enlargement of apposed PSD-95 puncta, while coexpression of SPO-shRNA and SPO rescue constructs restored the TTX-induced increase in PSD-95 puncta intensity in proximal CA3 synapses (Figure 6A–C) (pLL3.7 1.0±0.11; pLL3.7+TTX 1.8±0.28; SPO shRNA 0.4±0.06; SPO shRNA+TTX 0.6±0.08; SPO shRNA+rescue 1.8±0.22; SPO shRNA+rescue+TTX 2.4±0.34; P<0.05, one-way ANOVA and Tukey test). SPO knockdown and rescue had no effect on MF bouton size, however (Figure 6C) (pLL3.7 1.1±0.09 µm2; pLL3.7+TTX 1.2±0.08; SPO shRNA 1.2±0.13; SPO shRNA+TTX 1.1±0.08; SPO shRNA+rescue 1.0±0.09; SPO shRNA+rescue+TTX 0.9±0.09; P>0.15, one-way ANOVA). Together, these findings suggest that Spo function is required for inactivity-induced upregulation of presynaptic MF function and subsequent expansion of postsynaptic TE, but not for structural enlargement of MF terminals.\\nWe next examined the functional consequences of SPO knockdown and rescue by recording AMPAR-mEPSCs from the postsynaptic targets of GFP-expressing DG neurons. TTX treatment induced a significant increase in both mEPSC amplitude and frequency in DG targets (Figure 6D–F) (pLL3.7: 17.2±0.34 pA, 9.5±1.6 Hz; pLL3.7+TTX: 23.0±1.4 pA, 19.9±1.8 Hz; P<0.01 vs. pLL3.7, one-way ANOVA and Tukey test). SPO knockdown in presynaptic DG cells prevented the TTX-induced increase in both mEPSC amplitude and frequency (SPO shRNA: 16.3±0.4 pA, 9.6±0.8 Hz; SPO shRNA+TTX: 16.9±0.4 pA, 12.0±1.3 Hz, P>0.05 vs. pLL3.7, ++ P<0.01 vs. pLL3.7+TTX), while SPO rescue was sufficient to elevate mEPSC amplitude and frequency to TTX levels (Figure 6D–F) (SPO shRNA+rescue: 22.1±0.6 pA, 17.8±1.9 Hz; SPO shRNA+rescue+TTX: 21.1±1.7 pA, 23.2±3.4 Hz; P<0.05 vs. pLL3.7, P>0.05 vs. pLL3.7+TTX). Taken together, these results indicate that presynaptic SPO is necessary and sufficient for the homeostatic upregulation of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses.\\n', 'The ecdysteroid biosynthesis in the prothoracic glands (PGs) begins from conversion of cholesterol into 7-dehydrocholesterol (7dC), mediated by a Rieske oxygenase Neverland[13,14]. The conversion of 7dC into 2,22,25-trideoxyecdysone (ketodiol) is a series of hypothetical and unproven reactions, and is called ‘Black Box’ [15]. In Drosophila melanogaster and Bombyx mori, CYP307A1/A2 (SPOOK/SPOOKIER, SPO/SPOK) [16,17] and CYP6T3 [18] have been proven to be involved in the ‘Black Box’. Moreover, a paralog SPOOKIEST (SPOT, CYP307B1) was also found in CYP307 family [16,17]. RNAi mediated knockdown of spok in the PGs results in arrest of molting in D. melanogaster. Feeding two 3-oxo steroids, cholesta-4,7-diene-3,6-dione-14α-ol (Δ4-diketol) and 5β [H]cholesta-7-ene-3,6-dione-14a-ol (diketol), in the RNAi-treated larvae triggered molting, enhanced amounts of ecdysteroids and induced 20E inducible genes [19]. These results indicate that Δ4-diketol and diketol are components of the ecdysteroid biosynthetic pathway and lie downstream of a step catalyzed by SPOK/SPO. SPO- and/or SPOK-like proteins had found in other insect species in Diptera such as Bemisia tabaci[20], in Coleoptera such as the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum[21], in Hymenoptera such as Apis mellifera[22], in Lepidoptera such as Spodoptera littoralis[23], Manduca sexta[17] and Holcocerus hippophaecolus[24], in Orthoptera such as Schistocerca gregaria[25], and in Hemiptera such as Acyrthosiphon pisum[26]. Up to now, however, involvement of SPO in ecdysteroidogenesis has not been confirmed in other insect species except D. melanogaster and B. mori.\\nAlignment of CYP307A1 (SPOOK, SPO) sequences from five insect species.\\u2009SPO originates from Manduca sexta\\u2009(Ms) (ABI74778), Drosophila melanogaster\\u2009(Dm) (NP_647975), Tribolium castaneum\\u2009(Tc) (XP_969587), Acyrthosiphon pisum\\u2009(Ap) (XP_001946295) and Sogatella furcifera (Sf), respectively. Amino acids with 100%, 80%, and 60% conservation are shaded in black, dark grey and light grey. The characteristic P450 structure, membrane targeting hydrophobic segment, P/G rich domain, Helix C, Helix I, Helix K, PERF motif and Heme-binding domain are shown in the figure.\\nSPO sequence is similar to those from other insects. Insect CYPs have five insect conserved P450 motifs, i.e., WxxxR (Helix-C), GxE/DTT/S (Helix-I), ExxR (Helix-K), PxxFxPE/DRF (PERF motif) and PFxxGxRxCxG/A (heme-binding domain), where ‘x’ means any amino acid [40]. For SfSPO, Helix-C and Helix-I are not conserved. Helix-C had the amino acid sequence of H/YxxPR, and the amino acid sequence of Helix-I was GGHSA/V (Figure\\xa01).\\nIn insects, SPO belongs to CYP2 family. The N-terminus of SfSPO has one of the common characters in microsomal P450s, consisting many hydrophobic residues followed by a proline/glycine (P/G) rich region (Figure\\xa01).\\nSince the fundamental phenomena such as molting and metamorphosis are conserved during arthropod evolution, the Halloween genes are expected to be well conserved in insects [23,25,26,41-44], and in other arthropods [1,45]. In the present paper, the presence of Sfspo was demonstrated in S. furcifera. The primary structure of SfSPO has three insect conserved P450 motifs, i.e., Helix-K, PERF and heme-binding motifs. Similar structural characters have been documented in SPO- and SPOK-like proteins from other insect species of diverse orders such as Diptera [16,17,20], Coleoptera [21], Hymenoptera [22], Lepidoptera [17,23], Orthoptera [25], and Hemiptera [26]. The N-terminus of SfSPO has one of the common characters in microsomal P450s, consisting many hydrophobic residues followed by a proline/glycine (P/G) rich region. Consistent with the structural features, SPO is detected in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when the corresponding gene is transfected to Drosophila S2 cells [17,46]. Moreover, Sfspo showed three expression peaks in late second-, third- and fourth-instar stages. In contrast, the expression levels were lower and formed three troughs in the newly-molted second-, third- and fourth-instar nymphs. In the fourth-instar nymphs of the brown planthopper N. lugens[47] and in the sixth-instar larvae of a lepidopteran species S. littoralis, the level of ecdysteroid showed a peak in the later instar stage. In D. melanogaster larval stage, expression patterns of Dmspo gene undergoes dramatic fluctuations, consistent with circulating ecdysteroid quantity in the haemolymph: being high in late seconds, low in early third and high in late thirds [17]. Furthermore, we found in this study that Sfspo clearly had a high transcript level in the thorax where PGs were located. Similarly, Dmspo is expressed primarily in the PG cells of the ring gland in larval and adult stages [17]. Thus, the structural features and temporal and spatial expression patterns suggest that SfSPO might be involved in the ecdysteroidogenesis in S. furcifera.\\nRaw nucleotide reads of S. furcifera were downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database with its accession number SRP009194, and assembled into unigenes using Trinity software [56]. The annotated SPO from 4 representative insect species A. pisum, T. castaneum, M. sexta and D. melanogaster were downloaded from NCBI reference sequences (RefSeq) database. These protein sequences were used for TBLASTN searches of S. furcifera transcriptome data to identify hits at a cutoff E-value of 1.0-5. The nucleotide sequences of hits resulting from initial searches were annotated by blasting (BLASTX, e-values\\u2009<\\u200910-5) against a local protein database containing NCBI non-redundant proteins.\\nAfter full-length cDNA was obtained, we designed primers (Table\\xa01) to verify the complete ORF with the same PCR conditions outlined above. ORF was predicted using the editseq program of DNAStar (http://www.dnastar.com) and the features of the protein were determined by TargetP. The resulting sequence was submitted to GenBank (KC579454). The annotated SPO-like proteins from the 4 representative insect species mentioned above were aligned with the predicted LsSPOK using ClustalW2.1 [58].\\n', 'Provision of supplemental oxygen to maintain soft tissue viability acutely following trauma in which vascularization has been compromised would be beneficial for limb and tissue salvage. For this application, an oxygen generating biomaterial that may be injected directly into the soft tissue could provide an unprecedented treatment in the acute trauma setting. The purpose of the current investigation was to determine if sodium percarbonate (SPO), an oxygen generating biomaterial, is capable of maintaining resting skeletal muscle homeostasis under otherwise hypoxic conditions. In the current studies, a biologically and physiologically compatible range of SPO (1–2 mg/mL) was shown to: 1) improve the maintenance of contractility and attenuate the accumulation of HIF1α, depletion of intramuscular glycogen, and oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation) that occurred following ∼30 minutes of hypoxia in primarily resting (duty cycle\\u200a=\\u200a0.2 s train/120 s contraction interval <0.002) rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles in vitro (95% N2–5% CO2, 37°C); 2) attenuate elevations of rat EDL muscle resting tension that occurred during contractile fatigue testing (3 bouts of 25 100 Hz tetanic contractions; duty cycle\\u200a=\\u200a0.2 s/2 s\\u200a=\\u200a0.1) under oxygenated conditions in vitro (95% O2–5% CO2, 37°C); and 3) improve the maintenance of contractility (in vivo) and prevent glycogen depletion in rat tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in a hindlimb ischemia model (i.e., ligation of the iliac artery). Additionally, injection of a commercially available lipid oxygen-carrying compound or the components (sodium bicarbonate and hydrogen peroxide) of 1 mg/mL SPO did not improve EDL muscle contractility under hypoxic conditions in vitro. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that a biological and physiological concentration of SPO (1–2 mg/mL) injected directly into rat skeletal muscle (EDL or TA muscles) can partially preserve resting skeletal muscle homeostasis under hypoxic conditions.\\nA novel class of oxygen-generating biomaterials represents a viable solution for the direct provision of oxygen to hypoxic skeletal muscle in the event of compromised blood flow. Specifically, sodium percarbonate (SPO) is a fast-releasing oxygen compound that appears promising for tissue salvage applications. SPO is an adduct of sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide that, in the presence of water, readily decomposes into oxygen, water, and other salts. Previously, SPO has been used in commercial applications as a rich source of oxygen, such as in soil remediation to improve bacteria viability [14], as well as a cleaning agent for teeth [15], [16]. In addition, this material has also been used successfully as a therapeutic agent for skin wound healing in a mouse skin flap model by delaying the onset of necrosis up to 3 days and decreasing cellular apoptosis [17]. However, oxygen-generating compounds, including SPO, have not been tested specifically for skeletal muscle applications.\\nThe purpose of the current investigation was to determine if SPO could support skeletal muscle metabolism under hypoxic conditions, using the loss of contractility as a primary index of loss of metabolic homeostasis [25], [26]. To do so, we report a series of studies that encompass characterizing the SPO biomaterial in a cell-free environment (Study One) to testing identified biologically and physiologically compatible concentrations of SPO in skeletal muscle under hypoxic or ischemic conditions in vitro (Study Two) and in vivo (Study Three), respectively. Collectively, the findings of these studies demonstrate that SPO (1 mg/mL) represents a biocompatible oxygen-generating material capable of partially supporting skeletal muscle homeostasis under otherwise hypoxic/ischemic conditions.\\nA series of three studies was performed to establish SPO as an effective treatment for hypoxic skeletal muscle. In Study One, SPO biomaterial characteristics (e.g., pH changes, free radical production, and oxygen generation) were determined in a physiological cell-free system. In Study Two, SPO biocompatibility and its ability to maintain skeletal muscle homeostasis under hypoxic conditions in vitro was determined. To assess biocompatibility, C2C12 cell viability and isolated rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle contractility assays were performed across a range of SPO concentrations under oxygen-saturated conditions (ambient air or 95% O2, 5% CO2, respectively). Upon determining a biocompatible SPO concentration (1 mg/mL) for this model, the capacity of SPO to maintain EDL muscle homeostasis in vitro under resting hypoxic conditions and during an active fatigue protocol was determined. Finally, in Study Three, SPO was tested as a tissue salvage treatment in vivo in a rat model of hindlimb ischemia.\\nTheoretical Determination of a Therapeutic Concentration of SPO\\nThe goal of this study was to supply enough oxygen via SPO decomposition to at least maintain resting skeletal muscle metabolism at 37°C. Oxygen consumption for rat EDL muscle has previously been reported to be ≈0.06 µL/g/s at rest at 23–37°C [18], [19]. For the EDL muscles used in this study, which weigh, on average, approximately 130 mg, it is assumed that during the course of a 30-minute organ bath contractile protocol (described below) with a duty cycle approximating 0, the muscle will consume approximately 14.0 µL of oxygen in a resting state. The following equations were used to determine the concentration of SPO required to produce a comparable volume of oxygen:\\nSPO decomposes to generate oxygen according to the following equation:(2)\\nThe amount of SPO needed to generate the theoretical value for oxygen required by the resting rat EDL is:(3)\\nThe volume of solution administered to the tissue in vitro was selected as 20 µL: a volume that did not diminish in vitro force production (Figure S1). Concentrations of SPO solutions tested either in cell culture or in vitro contractility experiments included 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 mg/mL to determine toxicity, physiological compatibility and efficacy of SPO. Isolated EDL contractility experimental muscles received a total of 0.002, 0.02, 0.1, and 0.2 mg SPO– a range that encompassed the requirement of oxygen to maintain resting metabolism under these conditions (Eq. 3).\\nStudy I: Characterization of SPO Biomaterial in a Cell-free System\\nSodium percarbonate (SPO) was cryogenically ground (Freezer/Mill®, SPEX SamplePrep) for 30 minutes and sifted through a 25 µm mesh sieve to obtain a homogenous distribution of small particles. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Model S-2260N, Hitachi Co. Ltd., Japan) was performed to observe the particle size and confirm uniform diameters.\\nSPO was added to a physiologically relevant solution of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco®) at 0, 1 and 10 mg/mL, and oxygen generation, pH changes, and hydrogen peroxide production were measured (n\\u200a=\\u200a3). An Oxygen Biosensor System (OBS, 96-well plate, Becton Dickinson™) was used to determine oxygen concentration (mg/L) per the manufacturer’s guidelines. Briefly, samples in triplicate were placed in the wells, and the OBS plate was kept in a hypoxic glovebox system (Biospherix, Ltd.) set to ∼0% O2, 5% CO2. Fluorescence intensity of the OBS plate was read on a fluorometer (Molecular Devices, Spectramax M5; 485 nm excitation, 630 nm emission). Readings were correlated to fluorescence intensities of known dissolved oxygen concentrations of DMEM solutions obtained by incubating solutions under calibrated oxygen settings in incubators. pH measurements of solutions in 15 mL conical tubes were made using a pH probe (Accumet®, Fisher). Hydrogen peroxide content was quantified using an Amplex® Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Kit (Invitrogen®) [27]. Fluorescence was measured using a fluorometer (545 nm excitation, 590 nm emission). Oxygen, pH and peroxide measurements were taken periodically, up to 24 hours.\\nStudy II: In vitro Analysis of SPO\\nViability studies were performed to test cytocompatibility of SPO at concentrations later used in tissue studies. Murine myoblasts (C2C12, passage 5) were cultured in complete growth medium (DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin), plated at 3,000 cells/well in a 96-well tissue culture-treated plate and allowed to adhere for 24 hours in a 37°C humidified atmosphere of 20% O2 – 5% CO2. After attachment SPO at concentrations of 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg/mL (n\\u200a=\\u200a8/[SPO]in growth medium) was applied to the cells. Additionally, bovine catalase (100 U/mL), which accelerates the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen and acts as an antioxidant [28], was added to half of the wells at each [SPO]. After 2 hours of exposure to experimental treatments under normal incubation (20% O2 − 5% CO2, 37°C), a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed to assess metabolic function of the cells. In brief, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), MTT reagent was added to the wells for 4 hours (5 mg MTT/mL media), and the blue formazan precipitate was extracted from the mitochondria using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Absorbance of the solution was read using a spectrophotometer (Spectramax M5; 540 nm). Quantification of a viable cell population was expressed as the ratio of absorbance of the growth control (only cells).\\nThe capacity of SPO to maintain skeletal muscle contractility was further assessed under oxygenated conditions but with a fatiguing duty cycle (train duration/contraction interval; 0.2 s/2 s\\u200a=\\u200a0.1). Rat EDL muscle contractility can be preserved for ∼30 minutes in isolated preparations at physiological temperatures when the contractile duty cycle approximates zero [29], [33], [34]. However, as activity increases, and in suite the metabolic demand of the tissue, oxygen diffusion gradients in isolated muscle can be created, wherein even with 95% O2 perfused in the organ bath a hypoxic core within the muscle develops [33], [34], [35]. In this experiment, muscles underwent a similar pre-test, as described above, and then performed three bouts of 25 tetani (100 Hz, 200 ms train of 0.2 ms pulses, 2 s inter-train period, 0.1 duty cycle, 37°C) with 10 minutes rest between bouts. The active fatigue bout was estimated to result in a critical O2 diffusion radius of 0.2 mm [33], resulting in a 0.0674 cm3 hypoxic core within the EDL (considering the EDL as a cylinder with a 1 mm radius, a length of ∼3.3 cm, a mass of 130 mg, and a density of 1.06 g/cm3). To provide O2 to the entire hypoxic core (.0674 cm3×1.06 g/cm3\\u200a=\\u200a71.4 mg) assuming an oxygen consumption of 1.06 µL/s/g, as estimated from rat in vivo triceps surae contractile studies [20], a single bout required ∼ 3.78 µL of O2. Thus, with the delivery of ∼2.6 µL of O2 via SPO (1 mg/mL in 20 µL), we hypothesized a delay in the loss of contractility under these conditions. Tau (time to lose ∼63% of maximal active force) was calculated for each fatigue bout. To do so, contractions prior the peak measured force were removed (no significant differences between groups in the number of contractions to peak force was observed). Forces measured from the peak to the final tetani were fit with a single-decay exponential function:(5)\\nAdditional EDL muscle in vitro experiments were performed to compare SPO to an oxygen-carrying media designed for tissue salvage. Lifor® is a lipid-based oxygen carrier (LOC) for organ perfusion systems [6], [7], [8], [9], [36]. EDL muscles were injected with Lifor® and underwent contractile testing as described above for SPO-injected muscle.\\nStudy III: In vivo Analysis of SPO\\nIn vivo ischemia injury and SPO application\\nAfter observing that SPO injection partially preserved muscle contractility in Study Two, SPO was further tested in vivo in a rat model of partial hindlimb ischemia. Anesthetized rats were aseptically prepared for surgery by sterilizing the abdomen. A longitudinal incision was made along the abdomen. The thoracic aorta was uncovered, reaching the bifurcation to the left iliac artery. The artery, vein and nerve were isolated and the iliac artery and vein were separately ligated, using 5.0 silk suture, immediately distal to the thoracic bifurcation (i.e., proximal to any subsequent bifurcations). Animals recovered for 24 hours, at which time the TA muscle was treated with one of two treatment groups: 1) saline (vehicle) injections, and 2) SPO injections. Solutions were warmed to body temperature immediately before injection. In line with the boundary conditions for SPO treatment identified in Study Two, the TA muscle was injected with 40 µL of 2 mg/mL of SPO (4 injections of 10 µL each). Care was taken to position the injections directly into the TA muscle, with the four injections evenly spaced in four quadrants of the muscle. Assuming a resting rate of oxygen consumption of 0.06 µL/s/g [18], [19], this volume of O2 represents ∼22% of the O2 requirement of the TA muscle (425 mg for 30 minutes) while remaining within biocompatible limits defined in Study Two.\\nSodium percarbonate as received contains large particles making it incompatible for intramuscular injection (Figure 1A). Using cryogenic grinding and sifting, small homogenous particles were obtained, which exhibited diameters <25 µm (Figure 1A). These smaller particles readily dissolved and could be injected through a syringe needle. Absolute dissolved oxygen increased rapidly up to ∼10 mg/L at the highest studied concentration (10 mg/mL), which is slightly greater than the saturation of water but has been observed in hydrogen peroxide solutions [39]. After reaching a peak in the lower concentration (1 mg/mL), the oxygen concentration decreased over time, suggesting that the oxygen generation is short-lived (<3hours using this formation) and oxygen diffuses into the surrounding atmosphere (Figure 1B). Addition of SPO to physiological solutions caused an alkaline shift in the pH (Figure 1D), resulting from the carbonate ions released by SPO. pH returned to baseline values due to carbon dioxide gas exchange within the hypoxic incubators. Peroxide content of SPO samples was elevated within 3 hours of the reaction and peaked within 6 hours at approximately 10 µM, followed by a decrease towards baseline values within 24 hours (Figure 1C). These values were below toxic thresholds of peroxide observed in culture, which is approximately 10−3M [15]. At 24 hours, the hydrogen peroxide concentration was actually less for the 10 mg/mL than 1 mg/mL SPO group. Since hydrogen peroxide is less stable in more alkaline environments, the lower level of hydrogen peroxide detected is likely from the higher concentration of carbonate ions present which are able to create a more alkaline microenvironment. These findings suggest that hydrogen peroxide is a transient species instead of a stable byproduct of the reaction.\\nCharacterization of SPO chemical decomposition in an aqueous environment.\\n(A) SEM images of raw SPO particles before (left panel) and after (right panel) modifications to obtain small, uniform particles (<25 µm in diameter).

Values are means ± sem.\\nTo identify a biocompatible range of SPO for skeletal muscle applications, C2C12 myoblasts were incubated for two hours with SPO concentrations of 0.001–10 mg/mL. The metabolically active population of cells decreased (Figure 2A; *p<0.0001) in a SPO concentration dependent manner, wherein at low concentrations (0.001–0.1 mg/mL) cell viability was reduced by ∼20–40%, while at higher concentrations (1 & 10 mg/mL) nearly 100% cell death occurred. This was likely due to hydrogen peroxide production, as addition of the antioxidant catalase (100 U/L) completely removed the cytotoxic effects of 1 but not 10 mg/mL of SPO (Figure 2A; *p<0.0001).\\nBiological and physiological compatibility of SPO.\\n(A) MTT viability assay of C2C12 myoblasts in the presence of increasing concentrations of SPO with and without the presence of bovine catalase (100 U/mL).

(B) Effect of saline (dashed line) and SPO (solid lines, all concentrations) on EDL muscle contractility in an oxygenated (95% O2–5% CO2) environment. * Values are different from saline group within the denoted frequency (p<0.05). Values are means ± sem; sample sizes are listed in Table 2.\\nThe effect of SPO on contractility of isolated whole EDL muscle was determined in an oxygenated (95% O2 – 5% CO2) environment (Figure 2B). The effect of the delivery method (i.e., injection via needle) on EDL force production is demonstrated in Figure S1A. Compared to saline injected control muscles, injection of 0.1 or 1.0 mg/mL SPO did not deleteriously affect force production. However, SPO concentrations of 5 and 10 mg/mL SPO reduced force at higher (100–200 Hz; *p<0.0001 compared to saline injected muscles) but not lower (1–60 Hz) stimulation frequencies (Figure 2B). Moreover, injection of the individual components of SPO (sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide) at concentrations found in 1 mg/mL SPO did not alter force production compared to saline injected or SPO injected muscles (Figure S1B). Collectively, these findings indicate that SPO at concentrations of 1 mg/mL or less are biocompatible, both in terms of cell viability and whole muscle contractility, when antioxidants are present.\\nNext, we tested the ability of SPO to maintain skeletal muscle contractility under hypoxic conditions (See Figure 3A for experimental design). In response to hypoxia (95% N2- 5% CO2), saline injected muscle contractility was diminished by ∼55±6, 65±3 and 38±4% at 60, 100, and 200 Hz, respectively. The greater force deficit at lower, than higher frequencies after hypoxia resulted in a downward, rightward shift in the abbreviated force-frequency curve (Figure 3B). Following the hypoxic protocol, return to oxygenated conditions (95% O2 – 5% CO2) in a subset of control muscles restored ∼15% of maximal tetanic force (Figure S2), similar to previously reported findings [40]. SPO injection of 1.0 mg/mL but not 0.1 mg/mL significantly improved the maintenance of oxygenated, pre-hypoxic force at all stimulation frequencies (Figure 3B; *p\\u200a=\\u200a0.083 at 60 Hz, *p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0314 at 100 Hz, *p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0005 at 200 Hz, compared to saline injected muscles) –1 mg/mL SPO injected muscles had a 38±4, 50±5, & 18±3% force deficit at 60, 100, and 200 Hz, respectively. SPO (1 mg/mL) appeared to improve the downward shift of the force-frequency curve, although a rightward shift was still evident (Figure 3C; #p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0189 at 60 Hz, #p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0001 at 100 Hz for saline injected muscles; #p\\u200a=\\u200a0.004 at 60 Hz, #p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0001 at 100 Hz for SPO injected muscles). The SPO mediated maintenance of contractility was likely due to the catalytic decomposition of SPO forming O2, as muscles injected with the individual components of SPO (i.e., 1 mg/mL equivalents of sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide) did not improve the maintenance of maximal tetanic force compared to saline injected muscle (Figure S3; *p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0048).\\nIn vitro contractility of resting EDL muscles under hypoxic conditions with and without SPO.\\n(A) Force tracings of a representative untreated muscle during the hypoxic protocol are depicted. (B) Per muscle, forces measured under oxygenated conditions and at the end of the hypoxic period (60, 100, and 200 Hz) were normalized to the maximal force (200 Hz) measured under oxygenated conditions. * SPO 1 mg/mL is greater than saline at each stimulation frequency. (C) Additionally, per muscle, these forces were normalized to the maximal force measured during each respective gas condition. # SPO 1 mg/mL and Saline are significantly reduced after ∼20 minutes of hypoxia (p<0.05). Values are mean ± sem; sample sizes are listed in Table 2.\\nHistological and biochemical metabolic indices of hypoxia further corroborated the contractile findings, that 1 mg/mL SPO decomposition generated a volume of oxygen capable of partially maintaining skeletal muscle homeostasis under hypoxic conditions. In response to hypoxia, SPO injection partially preserved intramuscular glycogen stores (*p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0103 compared to uninjured muscle), which were nearly completely depleted in untreated muscles (*p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0001 compared to uninjured muscle) (Figure 4 D–F, H; #p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0477 between untreated and SPO injected muscles), suggesting a greater use of oxidative metabolism in coordination with SPO decomposition [1], [41]. Additionally, 1 mg/mL SPO injection significantly attenuated the increased presence of nuclear co-localized HIF1α (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.1480 compared to uninjured muscle), which was observed in untreated muscles following hypoxia (*p\\u200a=\\u200a0.001 compared to untreated muscle) (Figure 4 A–C, G; #p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0007 between untreated and SPO injected muscles). And lastly, free radical oxidative stress or lipid peroxidation (MDA muscle content) observed in hypoxic untreated muscle (*p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0229 compared to uninjured muscle) was attenuated following 1 mg/mL SPO injection (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.1256 compared to uninjured muscle) (Figure 4I; #p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0253 between untreated and SPO injected muscles). Collectively, these findings indicate that 1 mg/mL SPO partially prevented a hypoxia-induced metabolic sequela, and correspondingly preserved a greater level of contractility.\\nHypoxia-induced HIF1α accumulation, glycogen depletion, and oxidative stress with and without SPO.\\nHistological assessment of EDL muscles with HIF1α (A, B, C) and PAS glycogen (D, E, F) staining for uninjured (native) (A,D), untreated (B,E) and SPO (1 mg/mL) (C,F).

Lipid peroxidation was assessed by quantifying MDA concentrations (I). * p<0.05 compared to uninjured; # p<0.05 compared to untreated. Values are means ± sem; sample size\\u200a=\\u200a4–9/group.\\nWhole rat EDL muscles were also made to perform an active fatigue protocol in an oxygenated environment (95% O2–5% CO2) with or without SPO (1 mg/mL) injection. The premise of these experiments was that this level of activity at 37°C would induce the development of a hypoxic core (see methods;\\n[33], [34], [35]), which could conceivably be attenuated by SPO injection. In response to the contractile protocol, both saline- and SPO-injected muscles exhibited similar and significant active contractile fatigue profiles (Figures 5A & 5B, respectively). For example, during each successive fatigue bout, Tau was similar between experimental groups (Saline vs. SPO, n\\u200a=\\u200a3/group: Bout 1, 13.4±0.2 vs. 16.1±2.8 s, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.40; Bout 2, 11.9±0.4 vs. 14.4±2.5 s, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.38; Bout 3, 8.8±0.6 vs. 8.0±1.5 s, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.66). There were, however, significant differences between experimental groups in the rise in resting tension. While both groups had a similar resting tension during the first two fatigue bouts, throughout the third fatigue bout, resting tension was significantly greater for the saline than the SPO injected group (Figure 5C & 5D).\\nThe effects of SPO on EDL muscle in vitro contractility during activity under oxygenated conditions.\\nActive specific force (N/cm2) of saline injected (A) and SPO (1 mg/mL) injected (B) muscles was measured during three fatigue bouts of 25 tetanic contractions (100 Hz pulse frequency, 0.2 ms pulse width, 200 ms train) under oxygenated conditions (95% O2–5% CO2; 37 °C). Resting tension (N/cm2) of saline injected (C) muscles was significantly greater than SPO injected (D) muscle during the third fatigue bout (*p<0.05). Values are means ± sem; sample size\\u200a=\\u200a3/group.\\nTo demonstrate the utility of SPO-generated oxygen for the maintenance of muscle contractility under hypoxic conditions (95% N2–5% CO2), an oxygen-carrying technology designed for similar applications was tested for comparison. The lipid oxygen carrier (LOC) system (Lifor®) chosen has previously been shown to preserve renal tissue and cardiac muscle function following hypoxic conditions [6], [7], [8], [9], [36]. However, when injected into skeletal muscle the LOC system maintained maximal force (200 Hz) at a magnitude similar to saline injected control muscles (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.2037) and lesser than 1 mg/mL SPO (*p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0115) (Figure 6A–B, Table 2). A variety of experiments were conducted using the LOC as organ bath solution (as opposed to an injectable), which more closely approximates previously described methods of use for this LOC with other tissues [6], [7], [8], [9], [36], however, an improvement in the maintenance of force compared to saline injected muscle was not observed (data not shown). These findings lend further support that it is the generation of oxygen with SPO decomposition in a physiological environment that promotes the improved maintenance in contractility under hypoxic conditions.\\nComparison of an oxygen-generating (SPO) and an oxygen-carrying biomaterial for the preservation of EDL muscle homeostasis under hypoxic conditions in vitro.\\n(A) Active specific force (N/cm2) generated under oxygenated (dashed lines; 95% O2 – 5% CO2) conditions and then after ∼20 minutes (see experimental timeline in Fig. 3) under hypoxic conditions (solid lines; 95% N2–5% CO2) by EDL muscles injected with saline, SPO (1 mg/mL) and a lipid oxygen carrier (LOC). (B) Maintenance of oxygenated maximal isometric force (200 Hz) under hypoxic conditions was significantly greater for SPO 1.0 mg/mL than all other groups, * p<0.05. Values are means ± sem; sample sizes are listed in Table 2.\\nStudy III: In Vivo Evaluation of SPO in a Rat Hind Limb Ischemia Model\\nUpon finding that SPO generated oxygen was capable of partially maintaining skeletal muscle resting metabolism under hypoxic conditions in vitro (Study Two), we sought to determine the effectiveness of SPO for the preservation of ischemic skeletal muscle tissue in vivo. To promote ischemia in the rat hindlimb, the iliac artery was ligated for 24 hours, after which time the tibialis anterior muscle (the prime dorsiflexor) was treated and assessed for signs of tissue hypoxia. As a global metabolic index, TA muscle contractility was measured via neural stimulation of the common peroneal nerve in anesthetized rats (2.0–2.5%) for thirty minutes (contractions performed at 100 Hz, 200 ms, 5 minute resting interval) prior to harvesting muscles for glycogen content analysis. Over the 30-minute in vivo protocol, non-ligated control muscles did not demonstrate a reduction in torque and exhibited normal glycogen staining, indicating that with an intact blood supply, the contractile protocol does not induce fatigue (i.e., is not metabolically taxing) (Figure 7A). On the other hand, following iliac artery ligation, saline-injected TA muscles exhibited a ∼90% reduction in torque within 15 minutes, and out to 30 minutes, of contractile activity that corresponded with a nearly complete depletion of intramuscular glycogen (Figure 7A). These findings are consistent with others indicating increased susceptibility to muscular fatigue with hindlimb ischemia [38]. However, SPO injection maintained ∼30% of initial torque values out to 30 minutes of testing (Figure 7A; #p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0443) and maintained glycogen staining to a similar level as non-ligated muscle (Figure 7B, C–E; p\\u200a=\\u200a0.5687). These findings indicate that SPO-generated oxygen can, at least partially, maintain resting skeletal muscle metabolism in vivo in a model of partial ischemia.\\nIn vivo TA muscle contractility and glycogen depletion with and without SPO after 24 hours of hindlimb ischemia.\\n(A) Ratio of isometric torque (Nmm) measured during repeated tetanic contractions (100 Hz pulse frequency, 0.1 ms pulse width, 200 ms train duration, 1 contraction every 5 minutes) normalized to initial torque values.

This is the first report we are aware of that demonstrates that an oxygen-generating compound (SPO) ameliorates hypoxia-induced loss of skeletal muscle homeostasis and function both in vitro and in vivo. SPO was selected for this purpose because it theoretically produces sufficient amounts of oxygen to maintain skeletal muscle metabolism (Figure 1), via the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Herein we demonstrate, that a biologically and physiologically compatible concentration of SPO partially prevented: 1) the loss of contractility, HIF1α protein accumulation, glycogen depletion, and lipid peroxidation in vitro after a 30-minute incubation under hypoxic conditions (95% N2-5% CO2; 37°C) while muscles were relatively inactive (duty cycle <0.001); 2) the rise in baseline tension, indicative of a loss of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, in vitro during a contractile fatigue protocol (duty cycle\\u200a=\\u200a0.1) performed in oxygenated conditions (95% O2 – 5% CO2; 37°C); and 3) the diminution of TA muscle torque and glycogen depletion in a partial hindlimb ischemia model in vivo, again while the muscles were relatively inactive (duty cycle <0.001). Further, we demonstrate the utility of providing an oxygen-generating compound (SPO), as compared to an oxygen-carrying compound (see methods), for preservation of skeletal muscle contractility following an acute bout of hypoxia in vitro (95% N2-5% CO2; 30 min.; 37°C; duty cycle <0.001), in the absence of an intact vasculature. Collectively, the results of these studies support our overarching hypothesis that SPO, an oxygen-generating compound, has the capacity to support resting skeletal muscle metabolism under otherwise hypoxic conditions.\\nIn response to acute hypoxia, the loss of contractility in relatively inactive muscle results from an increased presence of free radicals and not the reduction of intramuscular high-energy phosphate content [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [40], [42]. In this way, diminution of contractility may serve as a protective mechanism, disallowing hypoxic muscle from using limited energy stores for increased activity [23]. Previous reports have demonstrated that the loss of muscle contractility in vitro is partially prevented by attenuating elevations of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species during hypoxia [22], [25], [40] or by the return to oxygenated conditions following hypoxia ([40]; Also demonstrated in Supporting Figure S2). While there are many potential sites and modes for redox modification of proteins to modulate skeletal muscle contractility (e.g., alterations in excitation-contraction coupling vs. myofilament cross-bridge formation) [43], the reduction of myofilament maximal Ca2+ activated force (Fmax) mediated by reactive oxygen species and potentially peroxynitrite has been identified as playing a significant role in hypoxia-related loss of contractility [40], [42]. In the current study, we observed that SPO (1 mg/mL) significantly attenuated the rise in oxidative stress observed in hypoxic saline injected muscles, indicating that SPO-mediated maintenance of contractility appears to be due to an attenuation of hypoxia-driven alterations of the cellular redox status. Further, the downward and rightward shift in the force-frequency curve that we observed after hypoxia in saline injected muscle is suggestive of potentially multiple sites of contractile disruption (e.g., EC-uncoupling and reduced maximal activated force). Of note, SPO injection appeared to improve only the downward, but not the rightward shift of the force-frequency curve – consistent with previous findings of ROS and RNS (peroxynitrite) reducing Fmax following hypoxia [40] or increased contractile activity under oxygenated conditions (95% O2) [44]. That the right-ward shift, indicative of EC-coupling disruption, was not affected by SPO treatment (Figure 3C) as compared to saline-injected muscles suggests that either a component of the EC-coupling machinery is more sensitive to hypoxia-driven perturbations to cellular homeostasis (e.g., [45], [46]) or that the injection itself is playing a role. Regardless, the findings of this study indicate that SPO conserves muscle contractility in hypoxic conditions by preventing related elevations in oxidative stress.\\nIt is well recognized that isolated whole rat muscle preparations have the potential to develop a hypoxic core during in vitro studies [35], even in supra-oxygenated conditions (95% O2) [33], [34]. As muscle temperature and/or activity increase, the estimated radius of O2 diffusion from the bath media decreases exponentially [33], and consequently, contractility is diminished. Additionally, contractility may be depressed by increased oxidative stress in superficial fibers exposed to supra-physiological levels of O2\\n[44], as well as ion (e.g., K+) diffusion related alterations in membrane polarization [47]. Herein, a fatiguing contractile protocol, using a preparation designed to exacerbate the development of hypoxia within the muscle (see methods), was implemented to test the capacity of SPO (1 mg/mL) to ameliorate contractile dysfunction related to the development of a hypoxic core. In this setting, SPO did not alter the loss of active force (Figure 5A & B). However, elevations of resting tension during the active fatigue protocol were attenuated by SPO injection (Figure 5 C & D). Previous reports on whole muscle or isolated fibers have demonstrated that a rise in baseline tension with hypoxia (or anoxia) and with increased activity is the result of elevated resting cytosolic Ca2+\\n[22], [48]. Specifically, the rise in resting tension in hypoxic diaphragm results from extracellular Ca2+ influx secondary to plasmalemma or T-tubule membrane damage, which may be attenuated by the removal of Ca2+ from the bathing media or by a superoxide scavenger [22]. Thus, the ability of SPO to attenuate elevations of lipid peroxidation in hypoxic muscle (Figure 4), may in part explain the improved maintenance of resting tension during the contractile fatigue protocol. Based on previous reports, it is expected that the observed maintenance of baseline tension by SPO would have a concomitant improvement in active forces [22], [49]. As a potential explanation for this unexpected observation, we posit that accumulation of extracellular K+ within the core of the depolarized muscle fibers irrespective of treatment [47], rendered these fibers insensitive to the electrical stimulus (0.2 ms pulse width) used in this study, but that they were still capable of contributing to resting tension. These findings demonstrate that 1 mg/mL SPO can effectively preserve components of resting homeostasis when the muscle is under oxidative stress imparted by metabolic activity.\\nFrom a clinical standpoint, the utilization of SPO technology to provide an adequate source of oxygen for cells and tissues would be of extreme value in cases where oxygen diffusion limitations exacerbate tissue damage and restrict the spectrum of therapeutic possibilities. Clinical evidence suggests the potential for oxygen to increase the efficiency of salvage of ischemic skin flaps/grafts [50] and crush injuries [51], [52] in humans in studies using hyperbaric oxygen treatment. This has also been an effective method to reduce skeletal muscle ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats [53], [54]. To investigate the capacity of SPO to preserve skeletal muscle homeostasis in vivo, an optimized SPO concentration and dosage were correlated from in vitro results and applied in a partial hindlimb ischemia rat model. This model has previously been shown to reduce blood flow to the lower extremities at rest and during activity and to diminish muscle function out to fourteen days after ligation [38]. In this scenario, SPO injection mitigated the impact of ischemia-induced muscle tissue hypoxia after 24 hours of iliac artery ligation, as reflected by an improved maintenance of anterior crural muscle contractility and glycogen preservation, compared to saline injected groups (Figure 7A). Interestingly, the amount of SPO injected into the TA muscle provided theoretically only ∼22% of the oxygen required for resting skeletal muscle of this size (see methods). However, even this amount of SPO- derived supplemental O2 appeared capable of partially preserving muscle homeostasis in this model. More comprehensive animal models and analyses should be performed to further optimize concentrations, volumes and perhaps improved formulations of, SPO.\\nThe primary advantage of an oxygen-generating versus oxygen-carrying material is the potential to deliver a sustained source of oxygen for the salvage of soft tissue following acute vascular trauma. The in vitro organ bath and in vivo studies performed herein validated the use of an oxygen-generating biomaterial, SPO, for the acute preservation of skeletal muscle viability in the absence of a functioning vasculature. Preceding the findings of the current study, SPO incorporated into scaffolds devoid of a vascular system has also been shown to improve cell survival and function of hypoxic 3T3 fibroblasts [55] and β cells and pancreatic islet cells [56]. In comparison, oxygen-carrying materials, such as PFCs, have improved skeletal muscle viability following ischemia, but these effects were observed with vascular delivery [57], [58]. To this end, the delivery of SPO for this indication (ischemic skeletal muscle secondary to vascular trauma/abalation) appears to be limited to intramuscular injection. While we demonstrate in the rat EDL muscle that bilateral needle injection results in acute reductions in contractility, it is not likely that this will present a significant limitation to translation to humans for the following reasons: 1) Intramuscular injection induces reparable damage to muscle fibers [59], which may result in an acute loss of contractility (as evidenced herein) but that would be far outweighed by the overall treatment outcome of greater soft tissue salvage; And, 2) intramuscular injection delivery in a matrix format that would allow for adequate diffusion of SPO through a large tissue bed is an accepted practice already utilized in clinical trials for other skeletal muscle therapies and indications [60], [61]. While the SPO injection protocol will clearly need to be further optimized in a large animal study, the present and preceding findings highlight oxygen generating materials as a potentially versatile system for providing required oxygen to cells and tissues under diverse conditions in which the vasculature is compromised or altogether absent.\\nThe primary goal of these studies was to determine if SPO could preserve skeletal muscle homeostasis in the rat EDL or TA muscles when oxygen delivery was compromised. The improved maintenance of TA and/or EDL muscle contractility when these muscles were placed under hypoxic or ischemic conditions appears to be directly related to the provision of supplemental oxygen via SPO. Several lines of indirect evidence support this supposition: First, injection of the individual components of SPO (i.e., H2O2 & H2CO3) did not improve (or exacerbate the loss of) contractility following an in vitro hypoxia protocol, indicating that it is the specificity for the production of O2 via the catalytic decomposition of SPO that is required for tissue preservation in these studies. Second, glycogen levels were partially spared following hypoxic or ischemia testing when SPO, but not saline, was injected, suggesting that SPO-derived O2 was capable of supporting oxidative metabolism to at least some extent [1], [41]. And lastly, SPO attenuated hypoxia-induced HIF1α accumulation within myonuclei in EDL muscle, which is recognized as the prime regulatory factor in skeletal muscle mediated, hypoxia-induced gene expression [62]. Therefore, we posit that SPO at 1 mg/mL is a biologically and physiologically compatible oxygen-generating biomaterial that, at the very least, can partially support resting metabolism and thereby prevent redox modifications that characterize the acute response to hypoxia and may lead to otherwise irreversible damage in skeletal muscle. However, one should keep in mind that skeletal muscle has a broad metabolic range, wherein metabolic activity may rise ∼6–10 times that of resting metabolism during intense activity [20]. In addition, human muscles are comprised of mixed fibers types with a continuum of metabolic and functional phenotypes that may present added challenges to SPO treatment [63]. It is currently unclear what the metabolic requirements are in vivo for tissue salvage following limb polytrauma, although there are reports indicating that skeletal muscle metabolism is elevated in response to injury [19] or trauma [64]. In short, based on our initial observations with this novel material, in the current test systems, it is reasonable to conclude that SPO-mediated oxygen delivery (even with this first generation biomaterial formulation) would be adequate for preservation of muscle homeostasis and function following traumatic injuries that are expected to largely eliminate voluntary movement of the damaged/affected limb. Future studies will be aimed at directly testing this hypothesis, by assessing the capacity of SPO to provide supplemental oxygen for the preservation of oxidative metabolism in the context of extremity trauma.\\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that utilizes oxygen-generating compounds to document mitigation of a hypoxia-induced loss of muscle homeostasis both in vitro and in vivo. Most current comparable therapeutic devices and technologies utilize materials with enhanced oxygen carrying capacity, but are largely dependent on an intact vascular network. The major advantage of SPO, in the context of limb polytrauma in which limb perfusion is compromised, is that it is a self-generating source of oxygen in aqueous environments. The studies presented herein are a promising foundation on which further development of this technology will continue in order to fill a translational research gap in the area of muscle tissue salvage and restoration.\\nPhysiological compatibility of the delivery of SPO and its components to isolated EDL muscle. (A) Effect of physical manipulations (needle) and vehicle (saline) injection on muscle contractility in oxygenated (95% O2–5%CO2) environment at 1, 60, 100 and 200 Hz stimulations. * Untreated muscle produced greater force at 100 and 200 Hz stimulations (p<0.05). (B) Comparison of SPO components (as in the 1 mg/mL dose of SPO) to saline and SPO injections. The individual components of 1.0 mg/mL SPO did not alter contractility as compared to either 1 mg/mL SPO or saline under oxygenated conditions. Values are means ± sem; sample sizes are listed in Table 2.\\nImproved maintenance of EDL muscle maximal tetanic force under hypoxic conditions. Maximal tetanic force values (200 Hz, 200 ms train) measured at the end of hypoxic protocol listed in Figure 3 are expressed as the ratio of initial oxygenated maximal force. * In comparison to all other groups, the 1 mg/mL SPO injection maintained a greater fraction of initial force (p<0.05). Neither the 0.1 mg/mL SPO or the components (at concentrations equivalent to 1 mg/mL) of SPO, altered the maintenance of initial force compared to saline injected muscle. Values are means ± sem; sample sizes are listed in Table 2.\\n', 'SARS coronavirus Urbani strain was obtained from the CDC, cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA (0.01 μg/μl) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and adenovirus and human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) DNA were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA).

The aromatic\\ngroup would be transferred to the substrate as part of a stereocontrolled\\nreductive elimination process to form the enantioenriched TPO. At\\nthe outset of our studies, we were aware of a report by Zhao that\\nracemic arylation of SPOs can be achieved with diaryliodium salts\\nand simple Cu catalysts.8 By applying the\\nknowledge accrued from our enantioselective arylation studies with C2-symmetric bisoxazoline ligands, we began our\\nstudies with the straightforward merger of these sets of reaction\\nconditions toward the development of a catalytic enantioselective\\narylation process (Scheme 1d).\\nWe began by attempting the asymmetric arylation\\nof SPO 1a with substituted DAIS 2a using\\n(S,S)-diphenylbisoxazoline 4a as the chiral ligand,\\ncopper(II) triflate as the catalyst, and Et3N as the base\\nin CH2Cl2 solution at room temperature (Table 1). Unfortunately,\\nonly traces of 3a were observed under these conditions\\n(entry 1). However, we found that using the hindered base di-tert-butylpyridine (dtbpy) afforded the arylated TPO 3a with low conversion but importantly with modest enantiomeric\\nexcess (56% ee) (entry 3). A survey of readily available ligands showed\\nthat changing substituents on the oxazoline moieties or using the\\ncorresponding tridentate pyridinebisoxazoline (pybox) catalysts led\\nto no improvement using dtbpy as the base (entries 4 and 5). However,\\nwe were delighted to find that changing the solvent to MeCN while\\nretaining (S,S)-diphenylpybox 4d as the ligand and dtbpy as the base resulted in a dramatic\\nincrease in the ee of 3a, but only a modest yield. Moreover,\\nchanging the base to NaHCO3 resulted in a significant increase\\nin conversion, with 3a isolated in 99% yield (with respect\\nto DAIS 2a) and high ee. Further improvement was achieved\\nby changing the base to K2HPO4, and we found\\nthat the presence of 2 equiv of water was important in securing a\\nreproducible and robust reaction. Thus, the optimal conditions involved\\ntreatment of 2 equiv of SPO 1a with DAIS 2a as the limiting reagent in the presence of 10 mol % Cu(OTf)2, 12 mol % pybox ligand 4d, 2 equiv of K2HPO4, and 2 equiv of water in MeCN with stirring\\nfor 12 h at room temperature, which gave 3a in 96% yield\\nwith 96% ee after purification by silica gel chromatography.\\nWith an optimal process in hand, we next investigated\\nthe scope\\nof the SPO component in this transformation (Table 2). Simple SPOs bearing methyl and n-alkyl substituents were arylated to give the desired TPOs 3b–d with excellent ee and yield. SPOs\\nwith secondary branched alkyl groups also were excellent substrates\\nfor the arylation and gave high yields of 3e and 3f with excellent ee. Substrates with branching adjacent to\\nthe P atom gave mixed results. While arylation of t-Bu- and cyclohexyl-derived SPOs resulted in good yields of 3g and 3h, respectively, the enantioselectivities\\nwere moderate. However, cyclopropyl- and isopropyl-substituted SPOs\\nunderwent arylation in excellent yields to give 3i and 3j, respectively, with high ee using slightly modified conditions.\\nMore functionalized substituents, including benzyl and CH2SiMe3 groups, also gave the desired products (3k, 3l) in comparably high yields and ee.\\nEnantioselective Arylation of SPOs:\\nScope of the SPO Component\\nFinally, we sought to access P-stereogenic\\ncompounds bearing three\\ngroups of differing steric properties, namely alkyl, aryl, and ortho-substituted\\naryl. To achieve this goal, we reacted SPO 1b with ortho-substituted\\nDAISs. The reaction occurred smoothly with o-trifluoromethoxy\\niodonium salt to form the electron-deficient PAMP10 analogue 3ag in excellent yield with very\\ngood ee. An o-tolyl iodonium salt reacted in almost\\nquantitative yield to afford 3ah, again with excellent\\nee. We were also pleased to find that ortho-halogenated iodonium salts\\nreacted smoothly to produce TPOs with a convenient handle for further\\nfunctionalization (3ai–3ak) in high\\nyields and ee.\\nReflecting on a possible mechanism for this enantioselective\\narylation\\nprocess, our first impressions were that the reaction would operate\\nas an arylative kinetic resolution process. On the basis of the formation\\nof TPO 3a, its enantioselectivity, and the assumption\\nof first-order kinetics, this arylative kinetic resolution displays\\na selectivity factor of 148. Although in principle the starting material\\nshould be produced with enantiomeric excess, we found that isolating\\nthe remaining starting material was not trivial. A deleterious oxidation\\nprocess transforms the remaining SPO into the corresponding phosphinic\\nacid derivative, which undergoes O-arylation to give the phosphinate.\\nHowever, it was possible to isolate the small quantities of the remaining\\nSPO, and we were surprised that this material was either racemic or\\ndisplayed very low enantiomeric excess and hence was not consistent\\nwith a classical kinetic resolution. To probe this unusual finding,\\nwe conducted a series of control reactions. We tested the stability\\nof enantioenriched SPO (−)-1c under a number of\\nconditions related to the optimal process and were surprised to find\\nthat in all cases the remaining SPO was partially or fully racemized\\nin the presence of any of the reaction components (Scheme 2a) and accompanied by significant\\namount of the corresponding of aryl phosphinate. While this configurational\\ninstability of the SPO is contrary to most reports in the literature,\\nwe believe that racemization is the result of acid generated as a\\nresult of the deleterious oxidation pathway.\\nWe also showed that the reaction\\nof enantioenriched (−)-1c under standard conditions\\nbut without the chiral ligand\\ngave a stereospecific arylation in moderate yield accompanied by oxidative\\narylation to racemic phosphinate 5a (Scheme 2b). Reaction of (−)-1c with (S,S)-4d·Cu(OTf)2 leads to the productive, matched formation\\nof the arylation product in high er. However, we were surprised to\\nfind that the supposed mismatched experiment (with (R,R)-4d·Cu(OTf)2) gave\\na similar yield and high er of the opposite enantiomer of the product,\\naccompanied by the corresponding arylated phosphinate in low yield\\nand enantioselectivity (Scheme 2c). We rationalize this observation on the basis that the\\nstarting enantioenriched SPO must be racemizing during the reaction11 to form quantities of the enantiomer that is\\nmatched to the catalyst being used, resulting in arylation to give\\nthe observed TPO enantiomer. Taken together, these experiments hinted\\nat the opportunity for a dynamic kinetic resolution arylation of a\\nracemic SPO, but all attempts to secure such a transformation have\\nfailed; clearly, the mechanism of this enantioselective arylation\\nprocess is more complex than simply a kinetic resolution. Despite\\nthis, it is clear that the distinct Cu-catalyzed arylation process\\nprovides an effective way to produce enantioenriched TPOs in excellent\\nyield with very high enantiomeric excess.\\n', 'Considering the importance of both phosphorylation and expression in BCR-ABL pathogenecity, we design a BCR-ABL dephosphorylation-degradation system named SPOA which is consisted of SPO fusion peptide and antizyme1. SPO fusion peptide is generated by fusing GRB2 SH2 domain, PTP1B/C, and ODC. SPOA binds to BCR-ABL Y177 through SH2, dephosphorylates BCR-ABL Y177 by PTP1B/C, and directs BCR-ABL to protesome for degradation by ODC-AZ1. Thus, SPOA uncouples downstream signal cascades triggered by phosphorylation of BCR-ABL Y177. Also, SPOA directs BCR-ABL to proteasome for degradation, therefore attenuates BCR-ABL downstream signal activation. In this work, we investigated whether SPOA dephosphorylated BCR-ABL Y177 and degraded BCR-ABL protein in ubiquitin-independent manner, and whether SPOA depressed the oncogenecity of BCR-ABL in imatinib sensitive and resistant CML cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms. We also evaluated the effect of SPOA on leukemogenesis in mice.\\nGRB2 SH2 domain, PTP1B catalytic domain (PTP1B/C), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) were fused to generate the SPO fusion constructs with HA tag incorporated to the C-terminal. GRB2 SH2 R27 residue was substituted by lysine to generate a mutant, which failed to bind with BCR-ABL Y177 termed Sm [24]. PTP1B/C D181 residue was substituted by alanine to generate a mutant without catalytic activity termed PTP1B/Cm (Pm). Similar to SPO, SPmO, SmPO, and SmPmO were constructed by different combination of Sm, Pm, and ODC (Figure 1A). SPOA system consists of SPO fusion peptide and antizyme1 (AZ1). GRB2 SH2 domain directs PTP1B/C to BCR-ABL Y177 site and labels BCR-ABL with ODC (Figure 1B). To clarify whether SPOA system has dephosphorylation effect, we tested phosphorylated BCR-ABL Y177 (p-BCR-ABL Y177) in imatinib sensitive K562 and 32DP cell lines, and imatinib resistant K562R and 32DP T315I cell lines. As shown in Figure 1C, in contrast to imatinib inhibiting p-BCR-ABL Y177 only in imatinib sensitive cells, SPO dephosphorylated BCR-ABL Y177 in all cell lines, including the CML cells bearing T315I mutation. To survey the substrate specificity of SPO, we tested the phosphorylation of normal c-ABL kinase, a crucial regulator for cellular physiological function and the closest relative of BCR-ABL kinase, and found that it was not inhibited by SPO. These results demonstrate that SPOA system dephosphorylates BCR-ABL Y177 both in imatinib sensitive and resistant CML cells without decreasing c-ABL activation.\\nThe gene encoding SH2, PTP1B/C, ODC, or AZ1 was amplified through PCR from human cDNA. SH2 R27K (Sm) and PTP1B/C D181A (Pm) mutants were generated by overlapping PCR. SH2, PTP1B/C, and ODC were stepwise inserted into pAdTrack-CMV vector at the Kpn I, Sal I, Not I, and Xba I sites to develop a fusion gene termed SPO. SPmO, SmPO, and SmPmO were constructed similarly. AZ1 was inserted into pAdTrack-CMV vector at the Kpn I and Sal I sites. HA or FLAG tag was respectively added to the carboxyl terminal of ODC or AZ1. The expression cassette was used to generate recombinant adenovirus using the AdEasy system as previously described [42]. Cells were infected at an MOI of 105:1 for K562 and K562R cells or 3 × 105:1 for 32D, 32DP and 32DP T315I cells.\\n', \"A series of general and selective Pd(II)-catalyzed Heck reactions were investigated under mild reaction conditions. The first protocol has been developed employing an imidazole-based secondary phosphine oxide (SPO) ligated palladium complex (6) as a precatalyst. The catalytic coupling of aryl halides and olefins led to the formation of the corresponding coupled products in excellent yields. A variety of substrates, both electron-rich and electron-poor olefins, were converted smoothly to the targeted products in high yields. Compared with the existing approaches employing SPO–Pd complexes in a Heck reaction, the current strategy features mild reaction conditions and broad substrate scope. Furthermore, we described the coupling of arylboronic acids with olefins, which were catalyzed by Pd(OAc)2 and employed N-bromosuccinimide as an additive under ambient conditions. The resulted biaryls have been obtained in moderate to good yields.\\nIn the early 1970s, Mizoroki [10] and Heck [11] developed a palladium(0)-catalyzed cross-coupling of olefins with organic halides. Later, several other catalytic protocols were used with variations in their coupling procedures by changing metal sources, ligands, additives or substrates [12–16]. The class of phosphine-ligated palladium complexes [17–21] represents the most frequently employed precatalysts to achieve high reactivities and selectivities for such reactions. However, such trisubstituted phosphines in the palladium complexes are often air-sensitive in nature and easily oxidized [22–23]. Therefore, a new class of secondary phosphine oxide ligands (SPO) has been explored for these ligand-assisted palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions [24–27]. This type of SPO ligand is stable towards air and moisture and convenient to handle compared to the conventional trisubstituted phosphine ligands. Despite this advantage, the potential of these ligands has not been fully realized in Heck arylation reactions. Up to now, only a few examples of utilizing SPO-ligated palladium complexes in oxidative Heck reactions have been demonstrated [28–31]. Previously, we also reported the synthesis of cobalt-containing SPO ligands and their palladium complex. This was successfully applied as a catalytic precursor in oxidative Heck reactions [32]. However, these reactions were carried out at high temperatures with limited substrate scope. Therefore, the development of an alternative general and mild procedure employing a stable and inexpensive ligand is still in great demand.\\nIn this article we report two new protocols for Heck cross-coupling reactions: (i) a stable SPO ligated palladium complex 6 catalyzed cross-coupling of aryl halides 1 with olefins 2 at 60 °C; and (ii) Pd(OAc)2 catalyzed arylation of arylboronic acids 4 with olefins at 25 °C (Scheme 1).\\nIn the presence of solvents, secondary phosphine oxide (RR'P(O)H) might undergo tautomerization, which generates a less stable phosphinous acid (RR'POH) species. Subsequently, its coordination to the metal center through the phosphorus atom forms a phosphinous acid–metal complex [54–56]. Thus, the resulting transition-metal complex might function as an active catalyst in various C–C-bond-forming reactions. Ackermann et al. reported the synthesis of stable N-aryl-substituted pyrrole and indole-derived SPO-preligands, which were utilized in Kumada–Corriu cross-coupling reactions [57]. Recently, we reported the synthesis and characterization of imidazole-based secondary phosphine oxide ligand 5 and its application in C–C-bond-forming reactions (Scheme 2) [58]. Furthermore, the application of complex 6 in cross-coupling reactions has been carefully studied. We found that complex 6 is an active catalyst for the Heck reaction of aryl halides with olefins under mild conditions.\\nSynthesis of imidazole-based SPO–Pd complex 6.\\nIn summary, we have developed two new protocols for oxidative Heck reactions employing Pd(OAc)2 as a catalytic precursor. The first method is based on coupling between various olefins and aryl halides utilizing an imidazole-based secondary phosphine oxide ligated palladium complex (6) under mild conditions. The yields of products obtained were excellent and in high regioselectivity. Compared with the previously described procedures for the Heck reaction of aryl halides as substrates employing a SPO–Pd complex as a catalyst, the method reported here has the advantages of having a stable catalyst system, general substrate scope, and mild reaction conditions (60 °C). Secondly, we also developed the Heck reaction of arylboronic acids with various alkenes employing N-bromosuccinimide as an additive and catalyzed by Pd(OAc)2, under base- and ligand-free conditions at 25 °C. The yields of the coupled products are moderate to good.\\n\", \"Patients (New York Heart Association functional classification: NYHA1-3) with left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) < 60%, as determined by echocardiography were enrolled. They were referred for the following (1) acute myocardial infarction, (2) old myocardial infarction, (3) arrhythmia, (4) dilated cardiomyopathy. Patients were excluded if they had any of the following, (1) obstructive lung disease, (2) a history of stroke, (3) a clinical sign of central nerve system impairment. Patients with ischemic heart disease were treated with plain old balloon angioplasty and coronary stent placement. These subjects were examined with overnight (for 9\\xa0h) saturation monitoring transcutaneously, for mean oxygen saturation, number of desaturations, lowest arterial oxygen saturation (SPO 2 ), mean heart rate and max heart rate. An oxygen desaturation index (ODI), the number of desaturations per hour of sleep was computed. A desaturation was defined as a > 4% decrease in the saturation level. Subjects with oxygen desaturation of 4% (ODI4.0%) ≥ 4/h were examined with polysomnography (PSG). PSG monitoring was performed with the Morpheus (Teijin, Tokyo) for 9\\xa0h. Ventilatory flow at the nose was measured with thermistors. Ventilatory movements of the chest and abdomen were monitored. SPO 2  was measured transcutaneously with fingertip pulse oximetry. Apnea was defined as continuous cessation of airflow for more than 10\\xa0s, and hypopnea was defined as a reduction in airflow for more than 10\\xa0s with oxygen desaturation of ≥ 4%. Apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) was calculated as the total number of episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep. An AHI > 10 was considered diagnostic of sleep apnea syndrome (SAS). An AHI of ≥ 10 to < 20 indicated mild SAS, ≥ 20 to < 30 indicated moderate SAS, and ≥ 30 indicated severe SAS. We defined CSAS group as patients with central sleep apnea events > 50% of total AHI, OSAS group is defined those with obstructive sleep apnea events > 50% of total AHI. We evaluated all patients' urinary and plasma catecholamines concentrations, serum BNP and serum human atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP) levels, renin, aldosterone and cortisol when they were clinically stable (just before discharge the hospital) and no medication changes within the preceding 2\\xa0weeks. Urinary catecholamines were measured from 24-h urine. We measured serum eNOS levels just before we procedure cardiac catheter examinations. The CHF-CSA patients, whose AHI was over 20, were treated with nocturnal supplements of oxygen (9\\xa0h per day). Nasal oxygen was administered at 2\\xa0l/min and was raised progressively to 3\\xa0l/min if disordered breathing resulted in ODI4% > 4/h. No patient treated with nocturnal oxygen had been previously treated for sleep disordered breathing.\\n40 patients were treated with diuretics, 60 with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin-receptor antagonists, and 24 with Ca blockers, 29 with β-blockers. 28 patients had diabetes mellitus, 37 had hyperlipidemia, 48 had hypertension, and 41 patients were smokers. The three groups were similar in age, sex, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), classification of NYHA, medications (ACEI, angiotensin-receptor antagonists, diuretics, digoxin, Ca blocker and β-blocker), mean systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and complications (diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and smoking) ( Table 1 \\n                      ). There was no correlation between AHI and ejection fraction ( r \\n                      = 0.195,  P \\n                      = 0.3112). The ODI4% of the CHF-CSA and the CHF-OSA group were significantly higher than CHF-N group (CHF-CSA: 12.44 ± 10.42, CHF-OSA: 14.53 ± 14.68, CHF-N: 1.71 ± 1.54 events/h,  P \\n                      > 0.0001). The AHI were not different between the CHF-CSA group and the CHF-OSA group. The three groups were similar in mean heart rate, max heart rate, mean SPO 2 , hemoglobin, serum adrenaline, dopamine, renin, aldosterone, cortisol, BNP and hANP ( Table 2 \\n                      ). Lowest SPO 2  were significantly lower in the CHF-OSA than the CHF-N and the CHF-CSA group. Compared among the three groups, the CHF-CSA group had significantly higher 24-h urinary adrenaline (CHF-CSA: 4.411 ± 2.940\\xa0μmol/day, CHF-OSA: 2.686 ± 1.084\\xa0μmol/day, CHF-N: 3.178 ± 1.778\\xa0μmol/day,  P \\n                      < 0.05). There were no significant differences in 24-h urinary noradrenaline, dopamine and plasma catecholamine levels. And serum catecholamines and 24 urine catecholamines were similar in the CHF-OSA group and the CHF-N group. 18 CHF-CSA patients with AHI > 20 (11 patients had old myocardial infarction or dilated cardiomyopathy, and 7 patients had acute myocardial infarction) were treated with nocturnal supplements of oxygen, we measured ODI4%, AHI, LVEF, mean heart rate, max heart rate, mean SPO 2 , lowest SPO 2 , eNOS, serum BNP, hANP, renin, aldosterone, cortisol, plasma catecholamines levels, and 24-h urinary catecholamines before oxygen therapy, and at four months after starting nocturnal oxygen ( Table 3 \\n                      ). Oxygen therapy significantly decreased ODI4.0% (from 12.31 ± 10.24 events per hour to 1.19 ± 1.12 events per hour, 12  P \\n                      = 0.0005), AHI (from 33.1 ± 11.3 events per hour to 6.23 ± 3.16 events per hour, mean change = 25.387 events per hour,  P \\n                      = 0.0004) and serum BNP (from 91.75 ± 80.35\\xa0pg/ml to 52.75 ± 45.70\\xa0pg/ml, mean change = 33.85\\xa0pg/ml,  P \\n                      = 0.0208) levels. LVEF, plasma and urinary catecholamine levels did not change significantly ( Table 3 ). Serum BNP of CHF-N patients did not change significantly (from 109.79 ± 143.41 pg/ml to 118.75 ± 187.49\\xa0pg/ml  P \\n                      = 0.2971). There were no significant difference in 24-h urinary catecholamines between patients treated with β-blocker and patients without β-blocker. Serum eNOS levels were lower in the CHF-CSA group and the CHF-OSA group than in the CHF-N group (CHF-CSA: 15.89 ± 10.75\\xa0pg/ml, CHF-OSA: 7.46 ± 3.91\\xa0pg/ml, CHF-N: 27.33 ± 14.83\\xa0pg/ml,  P \\n                      < 0.05). There were no difference in eNOS between ischemic heart disease and the other disease. Nocturnal supplement of oxygen did not reduce serum levels of eNOS.\\nThe aim of this study is to examine whether nocturnal supplemental oxygen reduces SNA, and prevents progress of CHF. Actually 24-h urinary adrenaline was significantly higher in the CHF-CSA than the CHF-N group, and nocturnal supplemental oxygen reduced serum BNP levels, but did not reduce urinary catecholamines. CSA occurs in approximately one third of patients with CHF  [21,22]  and may be associated with increased mortality compared with CHF patients without apnea  [23,24] . SNA are elevated in CHF-CSA and CHF-OSA compared with CHF-N and are related to CHF  [10] . Peter et al. showed that overnight urinary catecholamines can be an integrated markers of SNA, and overnight catecholamines were significantly higher in CHF-CSA than in CHF-OSA and CHF-N  [25] . Other study demonstrated a significantly elevated awake cardiac and total body norepinephrine spillover in patients with CHF-CSA compared with CHF-N and CHF-OSA  [10] . In this study 24-h urinary catecholamines were used as markers of SNA. The 24-h urinary adrenaline in the CHF-CSA group was higher than those of the CHF-OSA group and the CHF-N group, but serum catecholamines levels were not significantly different among the three groups. Urinary catecholamines levels may serve as more representative indicator of overall nocturnal sympathetic activity than spot serum sampling in the morning  [20] . Treatment for sleep apnea include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and supplemental oxygen. CPAP is the most widespread treatment, but because of relatively poor patients acceptance in some studies  [26] . We selected nocturnal oxygen therapy for the CHF-CSA patients. The treatment with nocturnal oxygen significantly decreased ODI4.0%, AHI, Serum BNP levels, increased mean SPO 2  and lowest SPO 2  at four months after oxygen therapy. But plasma catecholamines levels and 24-h urinary catecholamine levels did not change significantly at four months. The half-times of catecholamines are very short, the values changes easily react to the mental and physical situation of patients. It was difficult to equalize the situation of blood sampling. The early study of Harrison and colleagues  [27]  showed that at least in some patients, Cheyne–Stokes respiration decreased as pulmonary edema and heart failure improved. Margot et al. showed that SDB occurs commonly in patients presenting with an acute cardiovascular event, and when investigated in the short term, sleep-related breathing abnormalities are often transient, so sleep studies to investigate SDB should be carried out when the patient is clinically stable  [28] . BaHammam et al. reported that the AHI was lower at the point of 6\\xa0months after acute coronary event, than 3\\xa0days after acute coronary event  [29] . So every laboratory data and sleep study were examined when the patients were clinically stable; no change of medication was made during the period. In the case of acute coronary syndrome, we measured all data and study over 2\\xa0weeks after the acute coronary event, just before they left hospital. Javaheri et al. reported that low LVEF was associated with increased prevalence of CSAS  [30] . But there have been no reports proving that the LVEF (%) is related the AHI. All data reported was that mean LVEF was similar in CHF patients with CSAS and without CSAS. In our study there was no correlation between AHI and ejection fraction ( r \\n                      = 0.195,  P \\n                      = 0.3112).\\n\", 'Simulated SPO\\n2 \\nvalues associated with FIO\\n2 \\nand PaCO\\n2\\n/arterial pH\\n', \"The physical rearrangement of the surface, as presented above, is a versatile and easy way to control its wetting properties. On the other hand, the wetting properties of a surface can also be controlled depending upon its chemical restructuring. In short, water being a polar molecule should show stronger adhesion to a polar surface. PVDF can be either polar or non-polar depending upon the conformation of its chains and its crystallinity3839. Its crystalline β-phase, which has all the fluorine atoms on one side of the chain, is highly polar40. On the other hand, the surface of amorphous PVDF would be less polar because the chains are laid in a random fashion and cancel the effect of each other. So an amorphous structure is expected to pose a less binding surface towards a water drop and its sliding on such a surface is supposedly easier. In contrast to wide wisdom, we believe that even in a highly crystalline polymer, foreign polar molecules can weaken and replace the polymer–polymer interactions with polymer–molecule interactions and hence decrease its crystallinity41. Indeed SPO can be switched between “opened, highly polar” and “closed, less polar” form not only on exposure to UV and white light respectively but its open form is also stable in its solvents42. Accordingly, 10\\u2005wt.% spirooxazine (SPO) was blended with the polymer solution in Dimethylformamide (DMF) that acted not only as a common solvent for polymer and SPO but also caused the SPO molecules to convert into their “open, highly polar” form by creating a polar environment around them. This was evident by the dark blue color of PVDF-10\\u2005wt.% SPO solution, Figure 3a. DMF evaporated during electrospinning but in the mean time part of SPO open form was stabilized by a dipole-dipole interaction with the polymer, Figure 3b. That is why; the fibers had a grayish blue color right after electrospinning, Figure 3c. After blending SPO with the polymer, it was expected that the molecules of the photochromic compound could disturb the regular chain arrangement required for a crystalline structure since they acted as side branches and hindered the alignment of chains required for crystallinity, Figure 3b43. This could result in fibers being dominantly amorphous with consequent effects on the sliding angle of drop. Indeed, change in crystallinity after adding SPO was seen in the wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) analysis. For the neat PVDF fibers, a strong peak was observed, which suggested that they were dominantly crystalline in either β-phase or its resembling γ-phase, Figure 3d. These two phases are difficult to distinguish from each other by X-ray diffraction, but share a common property that both are polar and thus can ensure good stability of open form of SPO, which is also polar41. With the addition of SPO, the strong peak representing crystalline phase was eliminated. As discussed above, the amorphous PVDF being less polar, should offer a surface to the droplet that is only weakly sticky. Thus, the drop could slide on it at a lower tilt angle compared to that in the case of neat crystalline PVDF yarn, Table 2.\\nHowever, since a part of SPO embedded in the PVDF fibers was already in the open form, exposure to UV did not bring about such a big change in sliding angle which could be taken as a trend. This was supported by static contact angle measurement, which showed a very small effect, i.e., a change from 135° before UV to 131° after UV exposure.\\nHere it is worth mentioning that only slippy state of a hydrophobic surface is not important but also the sticky state has its own applications. We demonstrate here, the ability of random fibers mat to arrest a drop as a novel way to create two-dimensional patterns by using water drops as tiny ball lenses, Figure 4a. The drops were deposited on a mat of PVDF fibers containing 10\\u2005wt.% SPO, to write the word “LENS”. Upon orthogonal UV exposure, water droplets that acted as lenses, deviated the light, concentrating it on the point where the drop was in contact with the fiber mat, thus creating a kind of “UV hotspot”, Figure 4b. Each individual spot consisted of an inner dark blue area, (‘Region A', Figure 4b) because of exposure to highly concentrated UV dose. As the water lens concentrated the light in the centre, the area surrounding the darker region, directly under the curve of the water lens, did not receive any UV exposure and remained in the faint grayish blue color of original fibers (‘Region B', Figure 4b). The rest of the area (‘Region C', Figure 4b) also had a blue color but it was lighter than the ‘Region A' because here, UV was not concentrated. The image formed by selective UV exposure was erasable by intense white light, after which the surface was ready for the next patterning, Figure 4a. On the other hand, a similar pattern could also be made on PVDF film containing 10\\u2005wt.% SPO but since the film was not superhydrophobic, therefore the contact area of water drop with the film surface was bigger compared to that in the case of fibers, Figure 4c. Here, the darker area in the middle of impression made by the drop after UV exposure was about four times bigger more than that observed in the case of fibers. This meant that the light concentration effect and the minimum feature size producible on the film were far less than that on the fibers. The advantage of using water is the availability, ease of application and removal and no damage to the delicate substrate, which may be a concern if using other type of lenses.\\nPolymer solution for electrospinning was prepared by dissolving 11\\u2005wt.% of Polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) in N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF). For fibers loaded with 1,3-Dihydro-1,3,3-trimethylspiro[2H-indole-2,3′-[3H]phenanthr[9,10-b](1,4)oxazine] (i.e., SPO), 10\\u2005wt.% of it was added to the polymer solution. Electrospinning was done by pushing the polymer solution through a needle that was connected to a high voltage source of 8\\u2005kV. Because of electrohydrodynamic nature of the process, the polymer stretched into the form of fibers, which were collected at the base plate in the form of a mat. This mat was simply lifted from the target, spread over a glass plate, and subsequently tested for its wetting properties. Yarns were made by manually rolling and stretching a thin layer of mat collected on the target plate. These yarns were then laid over the glass plate, which was already covered with a layer of random fiber mat. The polymer film was made by blade casting method, from the same solution of PVDF that used for electrospinning of fibers.\\nContact angle and sliding angles were measured on OCA15 machine from ‘Dataphysics' using 14\\u2005μL water drops. To study the UV effects on contact angle and sliding angle, a UV lamp (Labino AB, 35\\u2005W) with its peaks intensity in the range of 365\\u2005nm was used. The writing with “water lenses” was carried out by manually delivering of 2\\u2005μL water drops on the random fiber mat surface in the form of a pattern. After the first writing, the surface was recovered by exposing it to white LED light source. For analyzing the effect of UV absorbents, suspended in the water, drops of colloidal silver and gold solution containing nanoparticles of size range 5–10\\u2005nm were placed over PVDF nanofibers containing 10\\u2005wt.% SPO. These were then exposed to a white light (Labino AB, 35\\u2005W) for one minute.\\n\", 'DRUGand    ALCOHOL^    DEPENDENCE    ELSEVIER    Drug and Alcohol\\nDependence 38 (1995) 19-24    Effects of chronic alcohol intake on the\\nvasopressin content in  the hypothalamic paraventricular and\\nsupraoptic nuclei of the  mouse.

Introduction    The hormone vasopressin is\\nprimarily synthesized in  the hypothalamus and transported and stored\\nin the  neurohypophysis in order to be released into blood\\ncirculation following physiological and chemical stimuli  (Schrier and\\nLeaf, 1981; Harding et al., 1992). The  supraoptic (SPO) and\\nparaventricular (PVN) nuclei of  the hypothalamus are the main sources\\nfor vasopressin  (VP), although VP is also found in other hypothalamic\\nand extrahypothalamic structures (Buijs, 1978; Caff and Van Leeuwen,\\n1983; Lind et al1985; Gulya et al.,  1991).    The synthesis and/or\\nrelease of VP can be altered by  ethanol intake, as it has been\\nreported that ethanol  treatment for 7 days results in a decrease of\\nvasopressin  mRNA levels in the hypothalamus, thereafter reducing    *\\nCorresponding author.    the synthesis of VP (Ishizawa et al., 1990;\\nGulya et al.,  1991). Since ethanol acutely inhibits VP release from\\nthe  posterior pituitary (Beard and Sargent, 1986), it has  been\\nsuggested that chronic exposure to this inhibitory  effect could lead\\nto an adaptative \\'down regulation\\' of  VP mRNA (Rehbein et al., 1986).\\nAssociation between salt-water balance, hypertension  and alcohol\\nconsumption has often been described  (Beevers, 1977) and several\\nlines of evidence support the  role of the PVN in the integration of\\nneuronal signals in-  volved in blood pressure control, drinking and\\narginine-  vasopressin release (Sawchenko and Swanson, 1983;\\nHarding et al., 1992).    In previous work, we have studied the\\nmorphometric  response to chronic alcohol intake of the subcommisural\\norgan (SCO), subfornical organ (SFO) and area post-  rema (AP)\\n(Ferres-Torres et al., 1985; Castaneyra-  Perdomo et al., 1991), three\\ncircumventricular organs  (CVO) connected to angiotensin II and\\nvasopressin    0376-8716/95/$09.50 1995 Eisevier Science Ireland Ltd.\\nAll rights reserved  SSDI 0376-8716(95)01095-0    20    E.

In\\naddition, the AP (Michelini et al., 1986),  and more specifically the\\nSFO, have been implicated in  the control of arterial pressure and\\nfluid balance. In our  work, we have described morphometric\\nalterations in  the development of these CVO (Ferres-Torres et al.,\\n1985; Castaneyra-Perdomo et al., 1991).    The aim of the present\\nstudy is to analyse by im-  munohistochemical and morphometric\\nprocedures the  effects of ethanol exposure during lactation combined\\nwith chronic postnatal ethanol intake on two hypotha-  lamic nuclei,\\nthe SPO and the PVN, related to vasopressin  and receiving specific\\nangiotensinergic innervation from  the SFO, pathways which have been\\nthen suggested to  play an important role in the control of body fluid\\nbal-  ance and central cardiovascular regulation (Tanaka et al.,\\n1985).    2. Method    Two groups of male albino mice, with 15 animals\\nin  each group, were fed with standard diet Panlab, A 04.  This diet\\nis nutritionally equilibrated and cannot have in-  fluenced the\\nfindings. The animals were sacrificed at the  postnatal 35th, 180th\\nand 365th day, each of these age-  subgroups consisting of 5 animals.\\nThe first group was  a control group, while the second experimental\\ngroup  received ethyl alcohol added to the drinking water (ad\\nlibitum) at a concentration of 20%, from birth till the day  of\\nsacrifice. Liquid intake in each group was measured  daily. Brains\\nwere fixed by perfussion through the left ven-  tricle with Bouin\\'s\\nfluid and postfixed in the same fluid  for 24 h, dehydrated and\\nembedded in paraffin under  standard conditions. Brains were cut in\\ntwo alternative  serial coronal sections of 10 ^m. A serial coronal\\nsection  was stained by the Kluver-Barrera method (Kler and  Barrera,\\n1953), and thereafter used for the morphometric  studies, and another\\nwas processed immunohistochem-  ically for the A-V as follows: all\\nsections from the dif-  ferent experimental and control groups were\\nincubated  on the same day and hour in the primary antisera for  24 h\\n(rabbit anti-arginine vasopressin; INC Immuno-  biologicals) at a\\ndilution of 1:2000 in a solution of buffer  phosphate saline 0.01 M,\\ntriton 0.2% and sodium acide  0.1%. Anti-rabbit IgG (whole molecule)\\nperoxidase con-  jugate (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:100 in the same\\nsolution  as the primary antisera, was used as a second antibody  for\\nl h. The peroxidase reaction product was visualized  through the\\ndiamino benzidine reaction. The intensity of  the inununohistochemical\\nreaction in the PVN and SPO  of these sections was compared\\nsubjectively (asigning a  value of + to +++ to each animal based on\\nthis intensi-  ty) and objectively (performing a densitometrical study\\nof six sections of every animal, using the \\'Magiscan\\' Image  Analysis\\nSystem; the results of this quantification are ex-  pressed in\\npercent, i.e., stained cells versus unstained cells  in each nucleus).\\nFor the morphometric study, the nuclear area of the  neurons of the\\nSPO and PVN was measured in the  Kluver-Barrera (Kler and Barrera,\\n1953) stained sec-  tions of each animal, using the Genias Program\\n(Joyce  Loebl) and the same image analysis system. Additional-  ly,\\nthe global volume of each nucleus was also calculated  using the\\nSerial Coronal Section Reconstruction System,  SSRS (Eutectic\\nElectronics, Inc.). For statistical evalu-  ation we applied a two-way\\nANOVA for comparison be-  tween the control and experimental groups,\\nand a post  hoc test (Bonferroni) for comparison between animals of\\nthe same age.    3. Results    No statistical differences in the\\nliquid intake existed be-  tween the control and experimental groups.\\n3.1. Paraventricular nucleus  3.1.1.

The  intensity of the reaction to the A-V (F = 23.409) is\\nhigher  in the experimental group than in the control group, at  the\\n35th (P < 0.01) (Fig. 1A and ID) and 180th days (P  < 0.01) (Fig. 1B\\nand IE), while at the 365th day the reac-  tion is smaller in the\\nalcoholic group (Fig. 1C and IF).    With regard to the age of the\\nanimal, the reaction is  more intense in the experimental group at the\\n180th day  (P < 0.05) (Fig. IE), while in the control group it is more\\nintense at the 365th day (P < 0.01) (Fig. 1C).    3.1.2.

In the PVN there are no sig-  nificant variations in the\\nnuclear area sizes and/or global  volume of the nucleus either between\\nthe control and  experimental groups, or between the animals of\\ndifferent  ages (Fig. 2A and 2C).    3.2.

The  results are similar\\nto those of the PVN (F = 26.146), show-  ing that the experimental\\ngroup had a more intense im-  munohistochemical reaction at the 35th\\n(P < 0.01) (Fig.  1A and ID) and 180th days (P < 0.01) (Fig. 1B and\\nIE),  while no significant differences were detected in the den-\\nsitometrical study at the 365th day (Fig. 2E).    With regard to the\\nage of the animal, both groups show  a more intense reaction at the\\n180th day (P < 0.05), but  while in the control group the reaction is\\neven more in-  tense at the 365th day (P < 0.01) (Figs. 1B, 1C and\\n2E),  in the experimental group the intensity of the reaction\\ndecreases again at the 365th day (P < 0.05) (Figs.

The global\\nvolume of the SPO (F = 5.617) is higher in  the experimental animals\\nthan in the control animals at  the 180th and 365th days (P < 0.01 and\\nP < 0.05, respec-  tively). Global volume increases with age in both\\ngroups  of animals, but while in the control group this increase  is\\ndetected in animals of 365 days (P < 0.05), in the exper-  imental\\ngroup the volume of the SPO is already bigger  in animals of 180 days\\n(P < 0.01) compared to younger  mice (Fig. 2F).    Thus, during\\nchronic alcohol intake, the intensity of  the A-V reaction in the PVN\\nand SPO is greater in the  experimental than in the control group at\\nthe 35th and  180th days, but not at the 365th day, the age at which\\nthe intensity of the reactions is similar in both groups.  In the PVN\\nthis increase in the intensity of the reaction  in the experimental\\ngroup is not accompanied by a parallel  increase in the nuclear area\\nsizes and/or global volume  of the nucleus. However, in the alcohol-\\ntreated group, the  SPO showed an increase in the nuclear area sizes\\nof its  neurons at the 180th and 365th days and an increase in  the\\nglobal volume at the same age stages.    4.

This transport from the SPO and PVN  to the NHY seems\\nto be modulated by angiotensin II  (AGII) through a connection from\\nthe anteroventral  region of the third ventricle and subfomical organ\\n(SFO)  to the SPO and PVN (Lind et al., 1985; Tanaka, 1989;    Bains\\net al., 1992).    Although many authors postulate that a more intense\\nimmunohistochemical reaction does not necessarily in-  dicate a higher\\ncontent of the antibody, in our experiment    we think that this\\nrelationship could be possible as several  previously established\\nconditions occur in this experiment:    (a) animals were fed,\\nsacrificed, fixed and embedded in  paraffin in exactly the same\\nconditions and (b), more  importantly, all the slides were processed\\nfor inununo-  histochemistry at the same hour and day and using ex-\\nactly the same solutions of the antibodies. On this basis,  we think\\nthat a more intense reaction to A-V suggests a  higher content\\nofvasopressin in the nucleus. The content    E. Carmona-Catero et al.\\n/ Drug and Alcohol Dependence 38 (1995) 19-24    23    ofvasopressin\\nincreases with age in the control group in  both PVN and SPO nuclei,\\nprincipally in the oldest, 365-  day animals. However, in the\\nalcoholic mice, this age-  dependent increase of the reaction is not\\nso striking. It  seems that alcohol treatment in some way influences\\nthe  normal increase with age of this peptide content of  hypothalamic\\nPVN and SPO nuclei. The more intense  reaction to A-V by the alcohol-\\ntreated animals at the 35th  and 180th days, suggests a higher content\\nofvasopressin  in the SPO and PVN. At the 365th day this difference\\ndisappears, and this fact could be related to the above  mentioned\\nincrease ofvasopressin content with age in the  control group and/or\\nto an increase ofvasopressin release  in the oldest alcoholic animals.\\nThe increase in vasopressin content in the studied  hypothalamic\\nnuclei could be due to an increase of  production or a decrease in the\\nrelease. Although the pre-  sent experiment and the morphometric\\nstudies cannot  clearly define which of these alternatives is more\\nimpor-  tant regarding the results, we may suggest an explana-  tion\\non the basis that the nuclear sizes represent an index  of the nuclear\\nfunction. Alcohol intake in mice, at least  during the first 180 days\\nof treatment, would produce an  inhibition of vasopressin release\\nand/or transport from  the SPO and PVN to the NHY and this inhibition\\ncould  in some way be related to an effect ofethanol on the cen-  tral\\nangiotensin II, which controls the regulation of this  release. In the\\nPVN the increase of vasopressin content  is neither accompanied by an\\nincrease in the nuclear area  sizes, which are known to be related to\\nthe functionality  of the nucleus (Edstrom and Eichner, 1960; Pez-\\nDelgado, 1984), nor with an increase of the PVN global  volume.\\nHowever, we have found that in the SPO these  morphometric parameters\\ndo increase significantly at the  180th and 365th days. So, in the SPO\\nthe increase of the  vasopressin content may presumably be due to both\\nfac-  tors, the inhibition of the release and an increase in the\\nproduction of the hormone. These results disagree with  the down\\nregulation ofVP mRNA suggested by Rehbein  et al., 1986, after chronic\\nexposure to ethanol and cor-  roborated later by other authors\\n(Ishisawa et al., 1990;    Gulya et al., 1991). It seems then that the\\nincrease of func-  tionality (increase of nuclear area sizes) that we\\ndetect here  only in the SPO is not enough to be shown in the global\\nVP mRNA hypothalamic levels, suggesting a parallel  decrease of\\nfunctionality in other hypothalamic sources  ofvasopressin.\\nConsidering that the SPO nuclear area is  slightly bigger in the\\nalcohol-treated animals at 365 days  (P < 0.05) (suggesting a higher\\nproduction ofvasopressin  compared to the control animals), while the\\nintensity of  A-V reaction is similar, we will suggest at this age an\\nincrease ofVP release or transport compared to the con-  trol group.\\nSeveral authors have reported a relationship between  voluntary\\nalcohol intake and central angiotensin II  (AGII) (Grupp et al., 1988;\\nHubbell et al., 1991; Grupp  and Chow, 1992); it would be the SFO\\nwhich mediates    the effect of systemically administered AGII on\\nalcohol  intake (Grupp et al., 1989). The SFO seems to play an\\nimportant role in the control ofvasopressin release from  the\\nposterior pituitary in response to AGII (Knepel et al.,  1982; lovino\\nand Steardo, 1984; Tanaka et al., 1987).  However, observations based\\non electrical and chemical  stimulation of the SFO, indicate that SFO\\nefferents have  both excitatory and inhibitory influences on the VP-\\nsecreting cells of the PVN (Tanaka et al., 1985, 1986;    Tanaka,\\n1989). It seems that excitatory effects would be  mediated through a\\nconnection of the SFO with the me-  dian preoptic nucleus of the\\nhypothalamus, while a  pathway through the region of the septum would\\nhave  inhibitory effects on PVN neurohypophyseal neurons. We  have\\npreviously reported alterations in the global volume  of the SFO after\\nchronic alcohol treatment and suggested  that the increase in its\\nvolume could be related to varia-  tions in salt-water balance and/or\\nblood pressure that  occur in chronic alcoholism (Castaneyra-Perdomo\\net al.,  1991). Although alcohol has been reported to enhance the\\nformation ofANGII in plasma (Ibsen et al., 1985; Wright  et al.,\\n1986), and Gulya et al. (1991) have communicated  that chronic ethanol\\ntreatment produces an increase in  plasma osmolality in mice, but not\\nan increase in plasma  levels of vasopressin after 7 days of ethanol\\ntreatment,  suggesting that dehydration occurs as a side effect of\\nchronic ethanol treatment, we did not detect any effect  on the amount\\nof drinking after ethanol treatment.    As all these data confirm the\\nimportance of angioten-  sin and SFO in the release of vasopressin by\\nthe hypo-  thalamus and suggest close relationships between ethanol,\\nVP, ANGII and SFO, we hypothesize here that our pre-  sent results\\nconcerning vasopressin content in the PVN  and SPO after chronic\\nethanol treatment could be related  to a possible inhibition in the VP\\nrelease due to an effect  of alcohol on the hypothalamic\\nangiotensinergic inner-  vation from the SFO, as we reported\\npreviously that this  CVO is also affected by alcohol treatment\\n(Castaneyra-  Perdomo et al., 1991). Considering that SFO efferents\\nhave shown both excitatory and inhibitory effects on the  PVN (Tanaka\\net al., 1985, 1986; Tanaka, 1989), and  chronic alcoholism seems to\\nincrease ANGII levels (Ibsen  et al., 1985, Wright et al., 1986), the\\ninhibitory effect on  VP release that we describe here could be\\nrelated to this  increase of ANGII levels. To prove this hypothesis,\\nfur-  ther experiments conducted to vary physiologically and/or\\nchemically the levels of systemic and central angiotensin  are being\\ndesigned, to see if manipulations in the levels  of this peptide\\nreverse the effects of chronic ethanol treat-  ment on the release\\nand/or synthesis of vasopressin by  the PVN and SPO.\\nAcknowledgement    This study was supported by the Consejeria de\\nEduca-  cion del Gobierno Autonomo de Canarias Projects Nos.\\n40/08.03.90 and 91/244.    24    E.

(B) Wild-type (FW1511) cells or cells harbouring the tpk1M164G, tpk2Δ, tpk3Δ alleles (tpk1-as, FW1762) were grown in YPD overnight, diluted to 0.2 (OD600), and subsequently cells were treated with 5μM 1NM-PP1or untreated. Cell density (OD600) was measured over time at the indicated time points. (C) IME1 promoter activity was measured in a diploid tpk1-as strains and the IME1 promoter fused to LacZ reporter (FW1976). Cells were grown in YPD overnight, diluted into YPD or shifted to sporulation medium (SPO), and samples were taken after 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours. β-galactosidase activity was measured using a quantitative liquid ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) assay (see Materials and Methods for details). The promoter activities are displayed in Miller Units, and the standard error of the mean of at least two biological experiments is shown. (D) Similar to C except that cells were shifted to SPO, SPO plus 2% glucose or SPO with 2% glucose and 5μM 1NM-PP1. Samples were taken at the indicated time points. (E) Similar to C, except that samples shifted to YPD or YP-acetate (YPA), YPA plus rapamycin or YPA plus 1NM-PP1. (F) Similar to C except that cells were shifted to SPO or YPD and treated with rapamycin, 1NM-PP1 or both compounds. (G) IME1 mRNA quantification of cells shifted from YPD to SPO or YPD plus rapamycin, 1NM-PP1, or both compounds. Samples were taken at the indicated time points. Total RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, and IME1 mRNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR. Signals were normalized to ACT1 levels. The standard error of the mean of at least two biological experiments is shown.\\nTo measure IME1 promoter activity in response to modulating PKA activity, we used an IME1-promoter LacZ reporter fusion (pIME1-LacZ) that was integrated at the IME1 locus without disrupting the endogenous IME1. This fusion serves as an accurate readout for IME1 promoter activity [7]. When we shifted control and tpk1-as diploid cells from rich medium containing glucose (YPD) to sporulation medium (SPO), a condition which induces IME1, β-galactosidase activity increased (S1B Fig and Fig 1C). The β-galactosidase levels were comparable between the two strains suggesting that tpk1-as allele does affect IME1 regulation in SPO (S1B Fig). As expected, IME1 promoter activity did not increase when tpk1-as cells were shifted to fresh YPD (Fig 1C).\\nUsing the tpk1-as and pIME1-LacZ system, we first determined whether glucose repression of IME1 is mediated by PKA signalling. Cells were shifted from YPD to SPO, or to SPO medium containing glucose in the presence or absence of the ATP analog 1NM-PP1 (Fig 1D). IME1 promoter activity was strongly reduced in the presence of glucose. In contrast, when PKA was inhibited IME1 promoter activity was comparable with cells grown in the absence of glucose. This result shows that glucose inhibits IME1 expression predominantly via the PKA signalling pathway.\\nTo examine whether PKA and TORC1 are the major mediators of nutrient control of IME1 expression, we inhibited either or both pathways in cells grown in rich medium containing glucose (YPD) (Fig 1F and S1C Fig). Inhibition of TORC1 had no effect on IME1 expression. In contrast, IME1 promoter activity strongly increased between 8 to 12 hours following treatment with PKA inhibitors. Interestingly, when both PKA and TORC1 were inhibited, IME1 induction was already noticeable at 4 hours, and peaked at 8 hours and was remarkably similar to levels seen in cells incubated in SPO medium (Fig 1F and S1 Fig). Similar results were obtained when IME1 mRNA levels were examined (Fig 1G). These data show that the combined inhibition of PKA and TORC1 activities is sufficient to mimic nutrient control of IME1 expression. We conclude that TORC1 and PKA are two major mediators of nutrient regulation of IME1 expression.\\nOur results show that inhibition of PKA leads to some degree of IME1 expression in rich medium (YPD) (approximately 50% of that observed in SPO medium; Fig 1F and 1G). One explanation for this observation is that PKA inhibition induces IME1 at low or intermediate levels in all cells. It is also possible that IME1 induction occurs only in a subpopulation of cells when PKA is inhibited. To distinguish between these possibilities, we measured the distribution of IME1 expression in cells by single molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) (Fig 2A). The technique can reliably measure absolute transcript levels in single cells [17]. To ensure that the signals were specific and probes entered the cells, we first measured IME1 and ACT1 transcript levels in wild-type and ime1Δ diploid cells that were induced in SPO medium (S2 Fig). While IME1 was expressed in the wild type, no transcripts were detected in ime1Δ cells. As expected, ACT1 levels were comparable between the two strains (S2B Fig). Next, we counted the mean number of IME1 transcripts in cells grown in rich medium shifted to SPO medium, or treated with PKA or PKA/TORC1 inhibitors (Figs 2A and 1B). The IME1 expression pattern matched the RT-PCR experiment (compare Figs 1G and 2B). In cells treated with the PKA inhibitor IME1 levels increased after 8 hours to about 10 copies per cell on average. When both TORC1 and PKA were inhibited, IME1 was transcribed efficiently and cells contained on average 30 copies per cell at 8 hours after treatment, which was comparable to IME1 levels in SPO medium (Fig 2B).\\n(A) Representative images used for the analyses of IME1 and ACT1 transcript levels in single cells. Cells harbouring tpk1-as (FW1762) were grown in YPD overnight and were either shifted to SPO, or diluted into fresh YPD plus rapamycin, 1NM-PP1 or 1NM-PP1/rapamycin. Cells were fixed, hybridized with probes directed against IME1 (AF594) and ACT1 (Cy5), and were imaged (see Materials and Methods for details). ACT1 was used as an internal control and only ACT1 positive cells were selected for the analysis. (B) Mean of IME1 and ACT1 transcripts’ number among single cells as described in A. Cells harbouring tpk1-as (FW1762) were grown in YPD overnight, diluted into fresh YPD plus 1NM-PP1 or 1NM-PP1/ rapamycin and samples were taken at the indicated time points. Cells were imaged and quantified (see Materials and Methods for details). At least, 60 cells (n = 60) were quantified per time point. The standard error of the mean of at least two biological experiments is shown. (C) Distribution of IME1 and ACT1 transcripts among single cells grown in YPD as described in A and B. Cells were binned in five classes of transcript levels (0 to 5; 6 to 10; 11 to 15; 16 to 20 and 21 or more transcripts per cell) and the percentages of each class contributing to the total population are indicated. At least, 60 cells (n = 60) were quantified per time point. The standard error of the mean of at least two biological experiments is shown. (D-G) Similar to C except that cells were grown in YPD overnight and transferred to YPD plus rapamycin (D), YPD plus 1NM-PP1 (E), YPD plus 1NMPP and rapamycin (F), or SPO (G). Samples were taken at the indicated time points. Cells were binned in five classes of transcript levels (0 to 5; 6 to 10; 11 to 15; 16 to 20 and 21 or more transcripts per cell) and the percentages of each class contributing to the total population are indicated.\\nIt is worth noting that IME1 mRNA levels decline sharply 12 hours after inhibition of the PKA and TORC1 pathways but remained elevated in cells incubated in SPO medium for the same amount of time (Fig 2B). Given that expression of IME1 is known to decline when cells undergo meiotic divisions, a plausible explanation is that progression into meiosis differs between the two conditions [18]. Indeed, when PKA and TORC1 were inhibited the majority of cells underwent meiotic divisions within 12 hours (see next section for details). In contrast, when cells were directly transferred from YPD medium into SPO medium sporulation did not occur efficiently, and it is likely that many (more than 50%) of the cells were arrested in intermediate stages of meiosis (S1 Table). Therefore a decline in IME1 was not observed at 12 hours (Fig 2B). Finally, we would like to point out that we did not see a decline in pIME1-LacZ reporter activity even when cells progressed into meiosis (Fig 1F). This can be explained by the long half-life of β-galactosidase (more than 20 hours) [19].\\nNext, we analysed IME1 abundance in single cells. We binned the single cell expression data into five classes of transcript levels (0–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20 and 21 or more transcripts). In untreated cells more than 95 percent of cells had no or low levels of IME1, whereas ACT1 was expressed strongly in the majority cells (Fig 2C). In line with previous observations, rapamycin treatment had no effect on IME1 expression (Fig 2D). Interestingly, when PKA was inhibited the majority of cells expressed no or low levels of IME1 (0–5 copies per cell), but approximately 20% of cells expressed high levels of IME1 (21 or more copies per cell) (Fig 2E). When both PKA and TORC1 were inhibited the majority of cells (more than 75%) harboured high levels of IME1 RNA, which was comparable to SPO medium (compare Fig 2F and 2G). These data complement our population based assays and show that inhibition of PKA/TORC1 leads to significant IME1 expression in the majority of cells grown in nutrient-rich conditions.\\nLittle is known about how nutrient signalling controls other aspects of sporulation. To determine the consequences of PKA and TORC1 inhibition on meiotic progression, we examined subsequent stages of meiosis by measuring the kinetics of meiosis in cells shifted to YPD containing inhibitors of PKA and TORC1. Interestingly, less than 15% of cells underwent meiotic divisions when only PKA was inhibited. Given that a significant higher portion of cells were positive for intermediate or high levels of IME1 compared to number of cells that underwent meiotic divisions (Fig 2D and 2E), the result suggests that events downstream of IME1 are perhaps not efficiently induced in these cells. More than 90% of cells underwent meiotic divisions when both PKA and TORC1 were inhibited (Fig 3A). Under this condition cells also formed spores, but 70 percent (224 out 320 spores) of spores formed colonies compared to 95 percent (304 out of 320 spores) for the wild-type cells induced to sporulate in SPO medium. This reduced spore viability was not due to the tpk1-as allele being hypomorphic, because the same strain sporulated efficiently and exhibited 94 percent (301 out of 320 spores) spore viability in SPO medium (Fig 3B). Apart from reduced spore viability, we also observed a strong enrichment for triads in cells treated with PKA/TORC1 inhibitors (Fig 3C). Although four DAPI masses formed during the two meiotic divisions, three were packaged into spores and one nucleus was evicted or degraded from cells (Fig 3C and 3D). We conclude that inhibition of TORC1 and PKA is sufficient to drive entry into and progression through the sporulation program.\\n(A) Kinetics of meiotic divisions (MI + MII) of cells harbouring the tpk1-as allele (FW1762) shifted from YPD to fresh YPD with no treatment (NT) (closed circles), rapamycin (open circles), 1NM-PP1 (closed triangles), or rapamycin/1NM-PP1 (open triangles). Samples were taken at the indicated time point, fixed, and DAPI masses were counted. Cells that contain 2, 3, or 4 DAPI masses were classified as cells that underwent meiosis. For each time point 100 cells were counted. (B) Quantification of sporulation efficiencies in control (FW1511) and tpk1-as (FW1762) diploid cells. Cell were grown overnight in YPD, shifted to pre-sporulation medium, and then transferred to sporulation medium (SPO). Percentages of sporulated cells were determined after 48 hours in SPO. (C-D) Quantification of number of nuclei and spores. Cells harbouring the tpk1-as allele were grown in YPD, shifted to pre-sporulation medium, and subsequently shifted to SPO medium or to YPD plus 1NM-PP1 and rapamycin. The percentage of cells harbouring three or four spores was determined at 24 hours after treatment (C). DAPI labelled nuclei were counted at 10 hours (D, left panel) and 24 hours (D, right panel) after treatment. For each time point, 200 cells were counted.\\nFirst, we analysed how IME1 expression is affected in respiratory deficient cells. Pet100 is required for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase. Yeast cells lacking the PET100 gene cannot respire. In line with previous observations, pet100Δ cells did not induce IME1 in SPO medium (Fig 4A, compare lanes 1–4 to 5–8) [7]. Likewise, cells treated with the drugs antimycin A (antimycin), which inhibits cytochrome c reductase, or oligomycin, which inhibits the Fo subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, did not induce IME1 (Fig 4B, compare lanes 1–4 to 5–8 and 9–12). Uncoupling of respiration from energy production by treating cells with CCCP which disrupts the proton gradient and thus reduces the ability of the ATP synthase to function led to similar results (Fig 4B, compare lanes 1–4 and 13–16). Thus, respiration is required for induction of IME1 expression in sporulation medium.\\n(A) Northern blot analysis of IME1 expression in control (FW1762, lanes 1–4) and pet100Δ mutant (FW1770, lanes 5–8). Cells were grown overnight in YPD medium and shifted to sporulation medium (SPO), and samples were taken at the indicated time points. (B) Similar to A except that cells (FW1762) were grown in pre-sporulation medium before shifted to SPO. Subsequently, cells were either not treated (lanes 1–4), treated with antimycin A (50 μM, lanes 5–8), oligomycin (10 μM, lanes 9–12), or with CCCP (20 μM, lanes 13–16). (C) Similar to A, except that cells were diluted into 1NM-PP1 and rapamycin containing YPD (lanes 1–16), and treated with antimycin A (lanes 5–8) or oligomycin (lanes 9–12). The pet100Δ mutant (lanes 13–16) was also included in the analyses. (D) IME1 promoter activity was measured using a diploid strain harbouring tpk1-as and the IME1 promoter fused to LacZ reporter (FW1976). Cells were grown in YPD overnight, diluted into YPD plus 1NM-PP1/rapamycin or shifted to sporulation medium (SPO) in the presence or absence of oligomycin (10 μM). Samples were taken after 0, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours. β-galactosidase activity was measured using a quantitative liquid ortho-Nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) assay (see Materials and Methods for details). The promoter activities are displayed in Miller Units, and the standard error of the mean of at least two biological experiments is shown. (E) Quantification of IME1 mRNA levels in a strain harbouring the GAL1 promoter fused to IME1 and GAL4-ER (FW3243). Cells were grown in YPD, shifted to pre-sporulation medium, and transferred to SPO in the absence or presence of antimycin A. The GAL1 promoter was activated using estradiol. Total RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, and IME1 mRNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR. Signals were normalized to ACT1 levels. The standard error of the mean of at least two biological experiments is shown. (F) Quantification of sporulation efficiency of strains and treatments described in C. At least n = 200 cells were counted at 48 hours after treatment. Untreated diploid cells were included as a negative control.\\nNext, we induced sporulation by inhibiting PKA and TORC1 in cells grown in glucose-rich medium, and tested whether respiration is required for IME1 expression. To our surprise, IME1 expression levels were comparable between control cells, and antimycin or oligomycin treated cells (Fig 4C, compare lanes 1–4 to 5–8 or 9–12). pet100Δ cells grown in YPD strongly induced IME1 when the PKA and TORC1 pathways were inhibited (Fig 4C, compare lanes 1–4 to 13–16). To further quantify IME1 promoter activity in respiratory deficient cells, we measured pIME1-LacZ reporter expression in oligomycin treated cells. As expected, in SPO medium the IME1 promoter stayed repressed when cells were treated with oligomycin. In YPD plus TORC1 and PKA inhibitors, IME1 expression accumulated with slightly slower kinetics in the presence of oligomycin but peaked to similar levels as control cells (Fig 4D). Finally we examined whether IME1 can be induced from a heterologous promoter in SPO medium when respiration is inhibited (Fig 4E). When we induced IME1 from the GAL1 promoter using a Gal4-estrogen receptor fusion (GAL4-ER) that can be activated by the addition of estradiol, IME1 was strongly induced. However, in cells treated with antimycin IME1 stayed repressed. Previous work showed that expression of mRNAs from different genes is also affected under this condition [7]. We propose that the effects are not specific for IME1, but either transcription or mRNA stability or both are generally affected when cells are starved and cannot respire. Notably, even though cells were able to express IME1 when respiration was inhibited in YPD medium with TORC1 and PKA inhibitors the vast majority of these cells did not complete gametogenesis (Fig 4F) indicating that other stages of sporulation require respiration. In conclusion, when sporulation is induced in the presence of ample nutrients, respiration is not required for IME1 expression. This result suggests that either respiration or fermentation can serve as energy providers for induction of IME1 transcription.\\nOur results show that inhibition of PKA and TORC1 activity is sufficient to initiate entry into sporulation. Although it is well established that PKA signalling inhibits sporulation, inhibition of TORC1 by rapamycin treatment has been reported to affect sporulation with different outcomes. We and others have shown that rapamycin can stimulate sporulation by inducing IME1 expression [7]. Moreover, inactivation of TORC1 was shown to stabilize Ime1 and promotes its nuclear localization [20]. However, others have found that rapamycin can also inhibit spore formation in budding and fission yeast when added to the SPO medium [21, 22]. These seemingly conflicting results prompted us to further examine how rapamycin and TORC1 control sporulation.\\nSch9 is a serine/threonine kinase that controls ribosome biogenesis, autophagy, and entry into stationary phase [31–33]. It is also directly phosphorylated by Tor1 [34]. First, we quantified IME1 promoter activity in sch9Δ mutant cells shifted from YPD to SPO medium. We found that IME1 promoter activity was only slightly higher in sch9Δ cells compared to control cells (Fig 7A). We next measured IME1 promoter activity in cells grown in rich medium using the tpk1-as allele. Upon inhibition of PKA, IME1 promoter activity was overall higher and accumulated with faster kinetics in sch9Δ cells compared to control cells (Fig 7B). These data indicate that Sch9 is a repressor of IME1. If Sch9 is the only downstream target of TORC1 that represses IME1 than lowering TORC1 activity in sch9Δ cells should not further affect IME1 expression. Indeed, rapamycin treatment did not further increase IME1 promoter activity in sch9Δ cells (Fig 7B, compare pink bars with light green bars). These results indicate that Sch9 mediates repression of IME1 by TORC1.\\n(A) IME1 promoter activity was measured in strains harbouring tpk1-as and pIME1-LacZ (control, FW1976) and sch9Δ (FW2498). Cells were grown in YPD overnight shifted to SPO and samples were taken at the indicated time points. β-galactosidase activity was measured using a quantitative liquid ortho-Nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) assay (see Materials and Methods for details). The promoter activities are displayed in Miller Units, and the standard error of the mean of at least two biological experiments is shown. (B) Similar to A except that cells were diluted into YPD with 1NM-PP1 or 1NM-PP1 plus rapamycin. (C) IME1 transcript distribution among single cells in control (FW1762), tco89Δ (FW1966) and sch9Δ (FW2437) strains (all in tpk1-as background). After 8 hours treatment with 1NM-PP1, cells were fixed, hybridized with probes directed against IME1 (AF594) and ACT1 (Cy5). Finally, cells were imaged and transcript levels were quantified (see Materials and Methods for details). ACT1 was used as an internal control and only cells positive for ACT1 were selected for the analysis. At least 120 cells (n = 120) were quantified. The error bars represent the standard error of the mean of two biological experiments. (D) Same treatments and strains as A and B, but here the percentage of cells that underwent meiotic divisions (MI+MII) was determined after 48 hours of treatment.\\nTo further analyse how Sch9 controls sporulation we measured IME1 levels in single cells by smFISH. We observed that in sch9Δ cells treated with PKA inhibitors the majority (more than 60%) of cells expressed more than 21 copies per cell (Fig 7C). Only a small fraction of cells did not induce IME1. Furthermore, the IME1 mRNA distribution pattern in sch9Δ cells closely resembled that of tco89Δ cells, which supports our finding that TORC1 repression of IME1 is mediated by Sch9. Finally, we measured how meiosis is affected in sch9Δ cells. In line with the IME1 expression data, the percentage of cells that completed meiosis was significantly higher (60% versus less than 20% in the control) in sch9Δ cells treated with PKA inhibitor (Fig 7D). In addition, in sch9Δ cells shifted from YPD to SPO the percentage of cells that underwent meiosis was substantially higher than in wild-type cells induced to sporulate under these conditions (90% versus 20%). Given that we only observed a small increase in IME1 under this conditions (Fig 7A), the result suggests that Sch9 may also inhibit meiotic progression downstream of IME1 induction and regulate events such as IME2 and NTD80 induction. In conclusion, TORC1-Sch9 signalling contributes to repressing IME1 expression and entry in sporulation in nutrients-rich conditions.\\nWe next tested whether Tup1-Cyc8 association with the IME1 promoter is important for IME1 repression. We found that Tup1 depletion was sufficient for the activation of the IME1 promoter (Fig 8D). In diploids cells harbouring a TUP1-AID fusion and expressing pTEF1-osTIR1, IME1 promoter activity (pIME1-LacZ) increased after treatment with IAA. In contrast, β-galactosidase expression was not induced in untreated cells or cells that only expressed Tup1-AID. Finally, we compared the level of IME1 induction between Tup1 depleted cells, wild type starved cells (SPO medium), and cells treated with PKA and TORC1 inhibitors grown in rich medium (Fig 8E). Overall IME1 promoter activity was similar under the different conditions, but increased more rapidly in Tup1 depleted cells compared to cells starved in SPO medium or treated with PKA and TORC1 inhibitors. We conclude that Tup1-Cyc8 is a key repressor of the IME1 promoter, and that PKA and TORC1 control Tup1 association with the IME1 promoter.\\nIn general, cells were grown overnight in YPD to saturation (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) at 30°C, then diluted to fresh YPD (OD600 = 1) and treated with different drugs or shifted to sporulation medium (SPO, 0.3% potassium acetate, 0.002% raffinose, pH 7.0). In some experiments cells were grown overnight in YPD, diluted to pre-sporulation medium (BYTA, 1% yeast extract, 2% tryptone, 1% potassium acetate, 50 mM potassium phtlhalate) for 16 hours, and subsequently shifted to YPD or SPO [62]. Rapamycin was added to cells in a final concentration of 1000 ng/μl unless written otherwise. 1NM-PP1 was added to cells in a final concentration of 3 μM.\\n(A) Cells harbouring the tpk1M164G, tpk2Δ, tpk3Δ alleles (tpk1-as, FW1762) were grown in YPD overnight, diluted to 0.2 (OD600), and subsequently cells were treated with 1NM-PP1, rapamycin, both or untreated. Cell density (OD600) was measured over time at the indicated time points. (B) IME1 promoter activity was measured in a diploid control strain harbouring the IME1 promoter fused to LacZ reporter (pIME1-LacZ) (FW612), and a strain harbouring tpk1-as and pIME1-LacZ (FW1976). Cells were grown in YPD overnight, shifted to sporulation medium (SPO), and samples were taken at the indicated time point. β-galactosidase activity was measured using a quantitative liquid ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) assay (see Materials and Methods for details). The promoter activities are displayed in Miller Units, and the standard error of the mean of at least two biological experiments is shown. (C) Similar as B except that IME1 tpk1-as (FW1976) cells were diluted into YPD and treated with rapamycin (1000 ng/ml), 1NM-PP1, or both compounds, or shifted to SPO. Samples were taken after 0, 1, 2, and 4 hours. (D) Similar to C, except that samples shifted to YP-acetate (YPA), YPA plus rapamycin or YPA plus 1NM-PP1.\\n', 'Osteotomies including pedicle subtraction (PSO) and/or Smith-Peterson (SPO) are used to facilitate surgical correction of adult spinal deformity (ASD), but are associated with complications including instrumentation failure and rod fracture (RF). The purpose of this study was to determine incidence and risk factors for RF, including a clinically significant subset (CSRF), after osteotomy for ASD.\\nIncidence rates of RF were: for entire population, 9.3\\xa0% (95 % Cl: 2.7\\xa0%; 15.9\\xa0%); for PSO, 16.2\\xa0% (95 % Cl: 4.3; 28.1); and for SPO, 2.6\\xa0% (95 % Cl: 0\\xa0%; 7.7\\xa0%); the OR of PSO versus SPO was 7.2 (95 % Cl: 0.8; 62.7, P\\u2009=\\u20090.1). CSRF incidence was 5.3\\xa0% (95 % CI: 0.2\\xa0%; 10.4\\xa0%). Significant risk of RF was revealed for following factors: fusion construct crossing both thoracolumbar and lumbosacral junctions (OR\\u2009=\\u20099.1, P\\u2009=\\u20090.05), sagittal rod contour >60° (OR\\u2009=\\u200910.0, P\\u2009=\\u20090.04); the presence of dominos and/or parallel connectors at date of rod fracture (OR\\u2009=\\u200910.0, P\\u2009=\\u20090.01); and pseudarthrosis at ≥1\\xa0year follow-up (OR\\u2009=\\u200928.9, P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Statistically significant risk of CSRF was revealed for fusion to pelvis (P\\u2009=\\u20090.05) and pseudarthrosis at ≥1\\xa0year follow-up (OR\\u2009=\\u200950.3, CI: 4.2; 598.8, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01).\\nAdult spinal deformity (ASD) is a debilitating condition that often requires surgical correction. The aging population, combined with an increasing number of spine fusion procedures, is increasing the prevalence of ASD [1, 2]. Osteotomy procedures, including Smith-Peterson (SPO) and pedicle subtraction (PSO) are effective procedures used to correct deformity and lead to improved clinical outcomes [3–6]. One important difference between these osteotomies is that SPOs only involve resection of the posterior column of the spine while PSOs involve a greater resection including the pedicle and wedge of vertebral body [7, 8]. As a result, one PSO can achieve greater correction (30–40°) than a single SPO (approximately 10°) [9–13]. Due to the physical differences in osteotomies, it would seem plausible that after PSO vs. SPO the spine and fusion construct would be subjected to different strains and subsequent complications. However, while mechanical complications after PSO have been well described, these complications after SPO haven’t specifically been of focus. Multiple authors have described increased complications [4, 6, 14–16], pseudarthrosis [3, 4, 14, 15, 17], and instrumentation failure including rod fracture (RF) in PSO patients [4, 6, 14, 18]. Of note, rod fracture often requires reoperation and studies have postulated a link between pseudarthrosis and RF [4, 6, 14, 18]. However, prior studies have not statistically confirmed this linkage due to study limitations.\\nRod fracture can be differentiated into two main subgroups: clinically significant rod fracture (CSRF) and non-CSRF (CSRF was termed “symptomatic rod fracture” in a previous study) [18]. CSRF can be defined as symptoms prompting evaluation (e.g., pain, neurological symptoms) and diagnosis of fractured rods via radiographic imaging or re-operation. CSRFs are often accompanied with radiographic signs of pseudarthrosis, new symptoms such as pain or radiculopathy, or resulting in loss of correction [18], while non-CSRFs by definition aren’t associated with patient symptoms or loss of correction. Previous studies have found that the incidence of RF varies widely after spinal correction, with a recent study citing a post-PSO incidence of 22\\xa0% for all RF including non-CSRF and CSRF [4, 14, 18, 19]. The largest study to date studying CSRF only, reported a lower incidence rate of 6.8\\xa0% in a population of ASD patients treated with long, >5 level posterior instrumented fusion, with a higher incidence in a subset of patients who underwent osteotomy at 15.8\\xa0% [18]. Of note, no large series to date has cited the incidence of RF and CSRF subset in a combined cohort of adult spinal deformity patients treated with either PSO and/or SPO and compared the incidence between the two procedures.\\nAfter institutional review board approval (COMIRB #14-1258), data was analyzed from 104 consecutive patients who underwent an instrumented posterolateral spinal fusion including a SPO, PSO, or combination for adult spinal deformity between 2007 and 2014 by 4 surgeons at a single institution. Inclusion criteria consisted of: 1) >18\\xa0years of age; 2) diagnosis of adult spinal deformity including the following etiologies: fixed sagittal imbalance, idiopathic and degenerative scoliosis or kyphosis, posttraumatic kyphosis, idiopathic flat back syndrome, and ankylosing spondylitis; 3) operation consisting of ≥2 level instrumented posterolateral fusion with lumbar or thoracic spinal osteotomy (PSO and/or SPO) with or without interbody fusion for spinal deformity; and 4) follow-up for up to 7\\xa0years. Exclusion criteria consisted of: 1) osteotomy procedure for other diseases such as: tumor or infection; and 2) latest follow-up <1\\xa0year unless re-operation for rod fracture 3) secondary operation with manipulation of instrumentation during first postoperative year, for reasons other than rod fracture (e.g., infection with primary instrumentation removal or exchange). These patients were excluded from risk factor analysis because their variables couldn’t serve as a uniform comparison against cases of RF. This thought was based on the possibility that the original rods could have been replaced or subject to different additional stressors (e.g., addition of iliac bolts during subsequent operation) than were primarily documented. Further, radiographic detection of callus ossification after fusion surgery typically requires 9–12\\xa0months. Thus, it could impact evaluation of a risk associated with pseudarthrosis. CSRF was defined as a combination of symptoms prompting evaluation (as described below) and radiographic and/or intraoperative evaluation, if re-operation was completed. The main clinical criteria included: new symptoms such as pain, neurological symptoms, prominence of instrumentation, or worsening of spinal deformity or loss of correction. Other symptoms prompting evaluation included an audible or tactile “pop.” Radiographic diagnosis included rod irregularities suggesting a crack or discontinuation of rod contour (Fig.\\xa01: a; b), particularly if accompanied by radiographic suspicion of pseudarthrosis. Pseudarthrosis was initially diagnosed via helical CT with sagittal and coronal reconstruction and confirmed intra-operatively via detection of spine movement between motion segments within the fusion mass.\\nSurgical variables: number of posterior levels fused, location of fused levels, fusion to sacrum, pelvic fixation, osteotomy type (SPO or PSO), and osteotomy location. It should be noted that all patients received bone grafting posteriorly, and were classified as posterolateral fusions. The specific type of bone grafting was not analyzed;\\nAll patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were included for RF and CSRF incidence analysis. Patients were then divided into SPO and PSO subgroups to determine incidence by osteotomy type. If patients had both SPOs and PSO, they were included in the PSO group only.\\nIn our case-series, incidence of RF was 9.3\\xa0% (95 % Cl:2.7\\xa0%; 15.9\\xa0%) with 7/75 patients experiencing fractures. By subtype 4/7 were classified as CSRF, resulting in CSRF incidence of 5.3\\xa0% (9 5% CI: 0.2\\xa0%; 10.4\\xa0%). When separated by osteotomy type, the RF incidence rate trended higher if operation included PSO (6/37, 16.2\\xa0%, 95 % Cl: 4.3\\xa0%; 28.1\\xa0%) versus SPO only (1/38, 2.6\\xa0%, 95 % Cl: 0\\xa0%; 7.7\\xa0%), but this difference was found to have borderline significance (OR\\u2009=\\u20097.2 95\\xa0% CI: 0.8; 62.7, P\\u2009=\\u20090.1). When CSRFs were separated by osteotomy type, the CSRF trended higher if operation included PSO (3/37, 8.1\\xa0%, 95 % CI: 0\\xa0%; 16.9\\xa0%) versus SPO only (1/38, 2.6\\xa0%, 95 % CI: 0\\xa0%; 7.7\\xa0%). The 3 non-CSRFs were not associated with symptoms, pseudarthrosis, and didn’t require re-operation. Six of 7 patients experienced unilateral rod fracture and 1 patient experienced bilateral rod fractures.\\nAmong surgical variables, fusion construct crossing 2 spine junctions (thoracolumbar and lumbosacral) was found to be a risk factor for RF with an OR of 9.1 (95 % CI: 1.0; 80.0, P\\u2009=\\u20090.05), Table\\xa03. A few other surgical variables having relatively high risk showed only borderline statistical significance (0.05\\u2009>\\u2009P\\u2009<\\u20090.2), in particular: osteotomy type - PSO vs. SPO (OR\\u2009=\\u20097.2, 95\\xa0% CI: 0.8; 62.7); fusion to sacrum (OR\\u2009=\\u2009N/A, P\\u2009=\\u20090.1); fusion to pelvis (OR\\u2009=\\u20093.2, 95 % CI: 0.70; 15.6); and ≥8 levels fused vs. <8 levels fused (OR\\u2009=\\u20093.8, 95\\xa0% CI: 0.4; 33.4), Table\\xa03. Surgical variables that did not show significant association with RF were primary surgeon, osteotomy location, use of navigation systems (navigation vs. non-navigation), and presence of interbody support postop.\\nThis study is a case-series of 75 consecutive ASD patients assessed for incidence and risk factors for RF and CSRF after instrumented posterior fusion and osteotomy (SPO and PSO). Total incidence of RF was 9.3\\xa0% with 16.2\\xa0% after PSO and 2.6\\xa0% after SPO. Clinically significant total rod fracture rate was 5.3\\xa0% and post-PSO rate was 8.1\\xa0%. Following risk factor analysis, statistically significant risk factors for RF were obtained: fusion construct crossing 2 spine junctions, sagittal rod contour >60°, presence of dominos and/or parallel connectors at date of fracture, and pseudarthrosis at ≥1\\xa0year follow-up. Statistically significant risk factors for the clinically significant subset were fusion to pelvis and pseudarthrosis at ≥1\\xa0year follow-up. Interestingly, most variables with increased risk, including those meeting statistical significance or borderline significance, were similar between total RF group and CSRF subset. However, due to the low number of only 4 CSRFs, most variables only met borderline significance.\\nSurgical variable risk factors meeting statistical or borderline significance for RF and CSRF included: fusion constructs crossing two junctions and fusion to the pelvis. In prior studies, fusion across junctional regions of the spine, lumbosacral or thoraco-lumbar has been shown to be a risk factor for complications and increased strain on instrumentation [9, 14, 30, 32]. However, pelvic fixation alone has not been previously described as having association with RF. We propose that the association between CSRF and pelvic fixation could be the result of a few possible underlying etiologies. First, pelvic fixation may be a confounder to fusion across the lumbosacral junction of the spine, as pelvic fixation can only be present in those with fusion across the lumbosacral junction. Supporting evidence showed a high risk, with borderline significance, toward a greater proportion of RF and CSRF subjects with fusion to the sacrum compared to non-CSRF subjects. Alternatively, pelvic fixation alone may increase rod strain as pelvic fixation has been shown to increase overall spinal construct stiffness, but may inflict pinpoint strain on the rods [35]. Supporting evidence is seen with multiple rods fracturing near or at iliac bolt connector. Lastly, an extremely unbalanced spine requiring additional support can be a factor necessitating pelvic fixation and thus contributing to rod stress. Therefore, a spine with a high degree of imbalance at baseline, rather than the pelvic fixation alone, may explain the association between CSRF and pelvic fixation. Supporting literature found increased risk for RF with increased baseline sagittal imbalance and increased SVA correction [19]. Another surgical variable showing increased risk for RF, but only meeting borderline significance, was osteotomy type - PSO vs. SPO. Prior studies haven’t quantified this risk. However, PSOs have a couple factors that may increase rod strain including absence of pedicle screws at PSO level and greater degree of correction obtained with PSO vs. SPO.\\nThe incidence of rod fracture varies depending on impact of different confounders. This study found incidence rates of 9.3\\xa0% for all RFs, 16.2\\xa0% for all RF after PSO, 2.6\\xa0% for all RF after SPO, 5.3\\xa0% for all CSRFs, and 8.1\\xa0% for CSRF after PSO.\\n', 'a Schematic displaying how TFs and Tup1–Cyc8 could interact at the IME1 promoter. TF =\\xa0transcription factor. b Diploid cells harbouring TUP1-AID and V5-tagged TFs (YAP6-V5, FW4214; SOK2-V5, FW4218; PHD1-V5, FW5056; MOT3-V5, FW4229; NRG1-V5, FW4230; NRG2-V5, FW5055; SKO1-V5, FW4224) were grown to exponential phase. As a control, TUP1-AID (FW5057) cells were also included, which also harbour a V5 tag. Cells were either treated with IAA or DMSO, and the binding of each transcription factor was determined by ChIP and normalised over HMR. Mean of n\\u2009=\\u20092 is shown. c Binding of Tup1 is affected in cells lacking transcription factor binding motifs in the IME1 promoter. Diploid cells with a chromosomal deletion of the IME1 locus, and an integrated plasmid that contained the full IME1 gene fused with sfGFP at the amino terminus and the wild-type promoter (pIME1-WT, FW5370) or the same construct with all the candidate motif sequences mutated (pIME1-bsΔ, FW5372) were used for the analysis. These cells also expressed TUP1-V5. The binding of Tup1 was determined by ChIP. Mean and SEM of n\\u2009=\\u20093 are shown. d Expression of Ime1 during entry into meiosis in pIME1-WT and pIME1-bsΔ cells. Strains described in c were grown till saturation in rich medium (YPD), grown for an additional 16–18\\u2009h in pre-sporulation medium (BYTA), and subsequently shifted to sporulation medium (SPO). The levels of Ime1 expression were determined by imaging and quantifying the fluorescent signals generated by sfGFP-Ime1 in single cells (n\\u2009=\\u200950 cells per sample). The mean of signals detected and error bars representing the 95% confidence interval are displayed. Unpaired parametric two-tailed Welch’s t test with 95% confidence was used and p values (** = ≤0.01, *** = ≤0.001) are indicated.\\nThe Tup1–Cyc8 complex dissociates from the IME1 promoter in cells exposed to nutrient starvation16. We hypothesised that TFs interacting with Tup1–Cyc8 at the IME1 promoter control Tup1–Cyc8 dissociation during IME1 activation. To examine this, we measured the binding of the TFs during activation of the IME1 promoter. In order to induce IME1 expression and meiotic entry, we typically grow cells in rich medium conditions containing glucose until saturation, then shift to pre-sporulation medium containing acetate to ensure that cells are not subjected to repressive glucose signalling to the IME1 promoter4,9. Subsequently, cells are starved in sporulation (SPO) medium (0.3% acetate), which induces IME1 transcription and meiotic entry. Both Pog1 and Tup1 were enriched at 0\\u2009h in SPO prior to IME1 induction. As expected, during meiotic entry (4\\u2009h in SPO) Tup1 dissociated from the IME1 promoter completely while Pog1 binding was maintained albeit to a reduced level (Fig.\\xa06a, right panel). In addition, we found that all eight TFs were enriched at the IME1 promoter prior to induction of IME1 (Fig.\\xa06a, left panel). Upon entry into meiosis (4\\u2009h in SPO), five TFs showed near background binding (less than three-fold) to the IME1 promoter, while three TFs (Yap6, Phd1 and Nrg1) displayed marginal enrichment (less than five-fold over background) (Fig.\\xa06a, right panel). We further performed a time course experiment with three TFs (Yap6/Sok2/Phd1) and Tup1. We found that IME1 bulk expression levels peaked at 3\\u2009h in SPO (Supplementary Fig.\\xa06a). Tup1 and Sok2 dissociated from the IME1 promoter in the early time points (1 and 2\\u2009h in SPO), while the majority of Tup1 and Sok2 was evicted at 4\\u2009h in SPO (Fig.\\xa06b). Yap6 and Phd1 displayed reduced binding at the IME1 promoter at 3\\u2009h in SPO and was thus slower than Sok2 and Tup1. We propose that the gradual dissociation of multiple TFs evicts Tup1–Cyc8 from the IME1 promoter.\\na Binding of TFs at the IME1 promoter prior to and during entry into meiosis. Diploid cells harbouring V5 tagged TFs (YAP6-V5, FW3833; PHD1-V5, FW4466; NRG1-V5, FW4393; SOK2-V5, FW5638; MOT3-V5, FW4383; SKO1-V5, FW4389; NRG2-V5, FW4396; SUT1-V5, FW6974; TUP1-V5, FW3456; POG1-V5, FW968) and control cells (untagged, FW1511) were used for the analyses. Samples for ChIP were taken at 0 and 4\\u2009h in SPO. Mean and SEM values of n\\u2009=\\u20093 is displayed, except for control (n\\u2009=\\u20092). b Similar as in a, except that multiple time points were taken to analyse the timing of dissociation of Tup1-V5, Yap6-V5, Sok2-V5 and Phd1-V5 from the IME1 promoter. ChIP signals were normalised over HMR, and the 0\\u2009h time point was set to 100%. The mean and SEM values of n\\u2009=\\u20093 (Tup1–V5), and the mean of n\\u2009=\\u20092 (Yap6-V5, Sok2-V5 and Phd1-V5) are displayed. c Nuclear signal of Yap6-mNG (FW7473), Sok2-mNG (FW7475), Phd1-mNG (FW7477), Tup1-mNG (FW7644) and Cyc8-mNG (FW7642) prior to (0\\u2009h in SPO) and during entry into meiosis (4\\u2009h in SPO). Each transcription factor was fused to mNeonGreen (mNG). These cells also expressed mCherry fused to SV40 nuclear localisation signal (NLS) (mCherry-NLS). As a control, the signals of cells harbouring no mNG-tag (FW5199) are displayed. The black bar indicates the mean signal, and each point indicates a single cell measurement (n\\u2009=\\u200950 for each sample). The error bars represent the 95% confidence interval.\\nOne possible mechanism by which Tup1–Cyc8 and TFs dissociate from the IME1 promoter is by re-localisation to the cytoplasm. Indeed, nutrient signalling via PKA and TORC1 can impact the localisation of several TFs42,43. We fused mNeonGreen to Sok2, Phd1, Yap6, Tup1 and Cyc8 (Supplementary Fig.\\xa06b). As expected, Sok2, Phd1 and Yap6 were concentrated in the nucleus. Neither protein abundance in the nucleus nor the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios were altered in cells prior to (0\\u2009h in SPO) and during entry into meiosis (4\\u2009h in SPO) (Fig.\\xa06c, Supplementary Fig.\\xa06c). Taken together, activation of the IME1 promoter correlates with dissociation of Tup1–Cyc8 and Tup1–Cyc8 recruiting TFs from the IME1 promoter, but likely not via a mechanism involving re-localisation of TFs to the cytoplasm.\\nOur observations indicate that Sok2, Phd1 and Yap6 are important TFs for IME1 repression. Next, we investigated how the three TFs control Tup1–Cyc8 recruitment in different nutrient conditions. We found that Tup1 binding to the IME1 promoter was not decreased by sok2∆, phd1∆ and yap6∆ single/double/triple deletions in rich medium containing glucose, suggesting that other TFs contribute to IME1 repression via Tup1–Cyc8 when glucose is used by cells as the carbon source (Fig.\\xa07a). In contrast, prior to meiotic entry (0\\u2009h in SPO) Tup1 binding was diminished in sok2Δ and sok2Δphd1Δ cells, but not in yap6Δ and phd1Δ cells (Fig.\\xa07a). Strikingly, Tup1 association with the IME1 promoter was severely reduced (less than three-fold over background) in sok2Δyap6Δ and sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells at 0\\u2009h in SPO. IME1 expression was inversely correlated with Tup1–Cyc8 recruitment to the IME1 promoter since IME1 was significantly de-repressed in sok2Δyap6Δ, sok2Δphd1Δ or sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells at 0\\u2009h in SPO (Fig.\\xa07b). Finally, we examined how Sok2, Phd1 and Yap6 mediated Tup1–Cyc8 recruitment contributes to the onset of meiotic entry. Cells harbouring sok2Δ or sok2Δphd1Δ underwent meiosis much faster than wild-type cells (Fig.\\xa07c). There was little effect on the onset of meiosis in the yap6Δ or yap6Δphd1Δ mutants. In sok2Δyap6Δ and sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells the kinetics of meiosis was slightly faster than sok2Δphd1Δ cells (Fig.\\xa07c). Approximately 50% of cells underwent meiotic divisions within 2\\u2009h in SPO for sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells compared to 3\\u2009h for sok2Δphd1Δ cells. We also analysed how the onset of meiosis is affected in sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δnrg1Δ cells (Supplementary Fig.\\xa07a). We found no difference in the onset of meiosis between sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δnrg1Δ and sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells, suggesting that Nrg1 is not involved in IME1 activation (Fig.\\xa06a, right panel). We conclude that Sok2, Phd1 and Yap6 direct Tup1–Cyc8 association with the IME1 promoter to ensure timely expression of IME1 in cells grown in acetate-containing medium. Our data further suggest that the IME1 promoter is regulated by multiple Tup1–Cyc8 co-repressor complexes.\\na Tup1 binding at the IME1 promoter in nutrient rich conditions (YPD) and prior to entry into meiosis (0\\u2009h in SPO) in wild-type cells (FW3456) or cells harbouring sok2Δ, phd1Δ and yap6Δ single deletions (FW3979, FW3991, FW3603); sok2Δphd1Δ, yap6Δphd1Δ and sok2Δyap6Δ double deletions (FW4710, FW4406, FW4239); and sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ triple deletions (FW4010). An untagged control (FW1511) was also included in the analyses. The mean and SEM values of n\\u2009=\\u20093 is displayed, except for sok2Δ, phd1Δ and the untagged control for which the mean of n\\u2009=\\u20092 is displayed. b\\nIME1 expression in deletion mutants described in (a). The signals were normalised over the ACT1 gene signals. Mean and SEM values of n\\u2009=\\u20093 are displayed. Two-way ANOVA analysis was carried out using the uncorrected Fisher’s LSD method with 95% confidence to compare IME1 expression in mutant cells against wild-type control cells at SPO 0\\u2009h. Non-significant (ns) and p values (** = ≤0.01, *** = ≤0.001, **** = ≤0.0001) are indicated. c Meiosis in mutant strains described in (a). Samples were taken at the indicated time points, fixed and DAPI masses were counted (n\\u2009=\\u2009200–300 cells per sample) to determine the percentage of cells that underwent meiosis (MI\\u2009+\\u2009MII). Cells harbouring two, three or four DAPI masses were classified as meiosis.\\nWhy do so many TFs (at least eight) associate with the IME1 promoter? One possibility is that the TFs facilitate Tup1–Cyc8 recruitment under different nutrient conditions. With this logic, repression of the IME1 promoter can be maintained under various nutrient conditions and will only be fully activated when all the nutrient signalling requirements are met. In agreement with this model, IME1 expression was only marginally increased in sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells grown in the presence of ample nutrients with glucose as the carbon source (YPD), and was significantly increased by nearly ten-fold in sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells grown in acetate-containing medium (Figs.\\xa05a, b and 7b). Furthermore, in YPD saturation when glucose is depleted from the growth medium, we observed that some TFs displayed altered association with the IME1 promoter. For example, Sok2 binding was increased, while Yap6 and Cyc8 association with the IME1 promoter was decreased (Supplementary Fig.\\xa07b). To examine how the different TFs respond to nutrient signalling at the IME1 promoter more systematically, we measured their association under different nutrient conditions (Fig.\\xa08a). We grew cells until the pre-sporulation stage, and subsequently shifted cells to sporulation medium (SPO) (1), SPO plus 2% glucose (2), YP (3) or YP plus 2% glucose (YPD) (4). First, we measured Tup1 association with the IME1 promoter. We found that in SPO plus glucose, Tup1 binding to the IME1 promoter was partially restored (Fig.\\xa08b). The association of Tup1 with the IME1 promoter was further increased in YP and was the highest in YPD growth medium. Pog1, the transcriptional activator of IME1, was enriched in all four nutrient conditions, but at higher levels in YP and YPD (Fig.\\xa08b). Interestingly, TFs important for Tup1–Cyc8 recruitment to the IME1 promoter responded to nutrient signals in distinct ways (Fig.\\xa08c). For example, Yap6, Sok2, Sko1 and Nrg1 associated with the IME1 promoter in response to the nutrient cues present in YP, but not to glucose signals alone. Phd1 binding partially recovered in the presence of glucose and showed the strongest enrichment in cells exposed to YP and YPD. Conversely, glucose signalling, but not YP, maintained association of Mot3 and Nrg2 with the IME1 promoter (Fig.\\xa08c). Finally, Sut1 association with the IME1 promoter was restored in YPD only.\\na Schematic of the experimental set up. Following growth in YPD and pre-sporulation medium, cells were shifted to SPO, SPO plus 2% glucose, YP or YP plus 2% glucose for 4\\u2009h. b Binding of Tup1 and Pog1 at the IME1 promoter under distinct nutrient conditions described in (a), as measured by ChIP. Diploid cells harbouring V5 tagged Tup1 (FW3456) or Pog1 (FW968) were used for the analyses. Normalised mean signals and SEM of n\\u2009=\\u20093 are displayed, except for Pog1-V5 in SPO plus 2% glucose, YP and YPD conditions for which the mean of n\\u2009=\\u20092 is shown. c Similar to b, except that V5 tagged Yap6, Sok2, Phd1, Nrg1, Mot3, Nrg2, Sko1 and Sut1 were used for the analyses (FW3833, FW5638, FW4466, FW4393, FW4383, FW4396, FW4389 and FW6974). Mean signals and SEM of n\\u2009=\\u20093 are displayed, except for Sut1-V5 for SPO plus 2% glucose, YP and YPD conditions for which the mean of n\\u2009=\\u20092 is shown. d Similar to b, except that Tup1 binding to the IME1 promoter was determined in the sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells (FW4010). Mean signals for n\\u2009=\\u20092 are displayed, except for 0\\u2009h in SPO for which the mean and SEM of n\\u2009=\\u20093 are shown. e Model for how nutrient signalling controls the IME1 promoter. Multiple Tup1–Cyc8 recruiting TFs associate in nutrient rich conditions with the IME1 promoter. During partial starvation some TFs dissociate from the IME1 promoter, but Tup1–Cyc8 remains bound. Upon entry into meiosis all TFs and Tup1–Cyc8 dissociate, and consequently IME1 transcription is induced.\\nGiven that Sok2, Phd1 and Yap6 were strongly enriched in cells exposed to YP medium (Fig.\\xa08c), we hypothesised that Tup1–Cyc8 association with the IME1 promoter is affected in sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells in YP, but not in SPO containing glucose. We therefore examined how Tup1–Cyc8 association with the IME1 promoter was affected in sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells under different nutrient conditions. Indeed, in sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells, Tup1 binding was detected in SPO plus glucose, but not in YP medium (Fig.\\xa08d). These data indicate that Sok2, Phd1 and Yap6 are important for mediating Tup1–Cyc8 association in YP, while other TFs are required for glucose signalling to the IME1 promoter (Fig.\\xa08e). In summary, our analyses revealed that the association of one set of TFs (i.e., Mot3 and Nrg2) with the IME1 promoter is induced by glucose signalling, while another set of TFs (i.e., Yap6, Sok2, Phd1, Sko1 and Nrg1) was recruited to the IME1 promoter primarily in response to the nutrient cues in YP. Thus, only when all the required nutrient signalling pathways are repressed, all TFs interacting with Tup1–Cyc8 dissociate from the IME1 promoter allowing activation of IME1 transcription. These data show that TFs important for Tup1–Cyc8 recruitment to the IME1 promoter respond to different environmental cues to ensure Tup1–Cyc8 mediated repression under various nutrient conditions.\\nYeast cells were grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) supplemented with 96\\u2009µg/mL tryptophan, 24\\u2009µg/mL uracil and 12\\u2009µg/mL adenine, grown at 30\\u2009°C and liquid cultures were agitated at 300 r.p.m. To obtain exponentially growing cells (YPD (E)) and cells grown to saturation (YPD (S)), cells were grown in YPD to saturation overnight, diluted to OD600\\u2009=\\u20090.2 and subsequently YPD (E) cells were harvested after two to three doublings. YPD (S) cells were grown for 20–24\\u2009h in YPD. To induce entry into meiosis, cells were grown overnight in YPD, shifted to pre-sporulation medium BYTA (1% yeast extract, 2% tryptone, 1% potassium acetate, 50\\u2009mM potassium phthalate) at OD600\\u2009=\\u20090.4 for 16–18\\u2009h, and subsequently transferred to sporulation medium SPO (0.3% potassium acetate, 0.02% raffinose, pH 7.0) at OD600\\u2009=\\u20091.8.\\nTo study the responses of the TFs in distinct nutrient conditions in Fig.\\xa08b–d, cells were grown in YPD and pre-sporulation medium following the standard sporulation induction protocol. Subsequently, cells were shifted to four different types of media including sporulation medium (SPO), glucose-only medium (SPO\\u2009+\\u20092% glucose), YP medium without glucose (YP\\u2009+\\u20090.05% glucose) and YPD medium (YP\\u2009+\\u20092% glucose). Yeast cells were harvested for ChIP analyses at the point of shift (0\\u2009h SPO) and after four hours in the different nutrient conditions.\\nFor determining the localisation of mNeonGreen-tagged TFs described in Fig.\\xa06c. and Supplementary Fig.\\xa06c, cells were induced to sporulate with the standard protocol. Subsequently, cells were imaged at 0\\u2009h in SPO and 4\\u2009h in SPO. Images were acquired using the same imaging system and set up described for quantification of sfGFP expressed in pIME1-WT and pIME1-bs∆ cells. Signals from whole cell and cell nucleus were quantified in the ImageJ 1.52a software and with use of the nuclear marker (2xmCherry-SV40NLS)60. Signal from the cytosol was inferred from the difference between whole cell signal and nuclear signal.\\n', '[Spectrometric investigation of the antioxidant activity of a novel synthetic selenadiazole derivative SPO against DPPH and ABTS free radicals].\\nThe antioxidant activity of a novel synthetic selenadiazole derivative SPO against DPPH and ABTS free radicals was evaluated using spectrometric methods. The results show that the detection wavelength and stable time for DPPH system were 515 nm and 30 min respectively, while those for ABTS system were 734 nm and 6 min, respectively. SPO could effectively and rapidly inhibited the formation of ABTS and DPPH free radicals in a dose- and time-dependent manner, indicating the potent antioxidant activity of SPO under both hydrophilic and hydrophobic conditions. In the optimized systems, the IC50 values of SPO were 85.2 micromol x L(-1) (DPPH assay) and 36.5 micromol x L(-1) (ABTS assay), respectively, which were comparable with the standard antioxidant Trolox, and significantly better than the positive controls BHA and BHT. Taken together, our results suggest the potential applications of selenadiazole derivatives as antioxidative agents.\\n', 'A specific secondary phosphine oxide (SPO) ligand (tert-butyl(phenyl)phosphine oxide) was employed to generate two iridium catalysts, an Ir-SPO complex and IrNPs (iridium nanoparticles) ligated with SPO ligands, which were compared mutually and with several supported iridium catalysts with the aim to establish the differences in their catalytic properties. The Ir-SPO-based catalysts showed totally different activities and selectivities in the hydrogenation of various substituted aldehydes, in which H 2  is likely cleaved by a metal-ligand cooperation, that is, the SPO ligand and a neighboring metal centre operate in tandem to activate the hydrogen molecule. In addition, the supported IrNPs behave very differently from both Ir-SPO catalysts. This study exemplifies perfectly the advantages and disadvantages related to the use of the main types of catalysts, and thus the dissimilarities between them.\\n', \"Retrospective analysis. To compare radiographical analysis and clinical outcomes of spinal osteotomy techniques, including Smith-Petersen osteotomy (SPO), pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO), and vertebral column resection (VCR), and analyze the relationship between preoperative evaluation and postoperative complication incidence. These 3 techniques have been extensively reported previously, whereas, few literatures are available on comparing these 3 techniques in management of severe pediatric spinal deformity. In all the 34 pediatric patients, 14 were treated with SPO, 12 were treated with PSO, and 8 were treated with VCR. All operations were performed by the senior author (L. X.) between 2005 and 2009 in the Institute of Spinal Deformity, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. Preoperative Halo-gravity traction was applied for 2 weeks in all patients; patients were evaluated by using standing radiographs taken before and after traction and after operation and a prospectively collected database with outcomes questionnaires. The postoperative complications and its relationship to preoperative assessment were also analyzed in this study. All the 34 patients' severe pediatric spinal deformity (22 females and 12 males) was diagnosed, with an average age of 11.97 years (range, 6-17 yr) and an average follow-up of 66.38 months (range, 48-97 mo). The mean preoperative major curve for each group was 103.43º in the SPO group, 108.08º in the PSO group, and 117.00º in the VCR group, and was corrected to 15.21º, 16.83º, and 25.88º, respectively. The apical vertebral translation was corrected by 73.29% by SPO, 73.35% by PSO, and 59.71% by VCR. The coronal balance was improved from 16.57 mm to 1.50 mm in the SPO group, 17.33 mm to 3.83 mm in the PSO group, and 29.38 mm to 3.63 mm in the VCR group. The mean correction of the kyphotic angle for single SPO was 19.00º, for those with 2 and 3 SPOs, the average correction was 34.40º and 47.5º, and 33.83º for the PSO group, 47.38º for the VCR group. There were significant improvements in the overall clinical outcomes. The overall complication rate was 35.3%. The complication rate was high in patients with respiratory insufficiency and rigid spine. There was no significant difference in coronal correction among these 3 techniques, whereas, the average corrections in the sagittal plane were progressively higher from single SPO to 2 SPOs or PSO to 3 SPOs or VCR. Preoperative respiratory insufficiency and rigidity of the spinal deformity are associated with a high complication rate. 3.\\n\", 'Recent studies implicate the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in septopreoptic (SPO) mechanisms that suppress preovulatory pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion during neuroglucopenia. Since Fos immunolabeling of the SPO of rats treated by caudal fourth ventricular (CV4) administration of the glucose antimetabolite, 5-thioglucose (5TG), parallels the distribution of GABA neuronal perikarya, the current studies investigated the genomic responsiveness of neuroanatomically-defined populations of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-immunoreactive (-ir) neurons in this region of the brain to hindbrain glucoprivation. In lieu of reports that CV4 5TG enhances SPO GABA turnover via mu opioid receptor (mu-R)-dependent mechanisms and evidence that GAD- and mu-R-ir are codistributed within the SPO, patterns of cellular colocalization of these antigens were also evaluated here. Neural tissue was obtained from groups of steroid-primed ovariectomized female rats 2 h after CV4 injection of vehicle or 5TG. Neuronal cell bodies in the lateral and medial septum, medial (MPN) and median preoptic nuclei (MEPO), and rostral medial preoptic area (rMPO) were immunostained for cytoplasmic GAD-ir, but only GAD-reactive neurons in the rMPO and MEPO exhibited robust nuclear colabeling for Fos in response to 5TG. SPO GABA neurons in the vehicle-treated controls were uniformly Fos-ir-negative. Dual immunolabeling for GAD- and mu-R revealed approximately 52% and 36% colabeling of this phenotype in the MEPO and MPN, and colocalization of lesser magnitude (18%) in the rMPO. These results demonstrate site-specific genomic activation of GABAergic neurons in the female rat SPO by CV4 glucose antimetabolite administration, and implicate MEPO and rMPO GABA cell populations in neural pathways that mediate regulatory effects of hindbrain glucoprivic signaling on CNS functions, including inhibition of the steroid positive feedback-activated gonadotropin-releasing hormone/LH neuroendocrine axis. The current studies also support the view that a proportion of neuroglucoprivic-sensitive GABA neurons in the MEPO and rMPO may be direct substrates for mu-R ligand modulatory actions during this state of central substrate imbalance.\\n', 'The Halloween gene SPOOK (SPO) is involved in the production of the active metabolite of ecdysteroid, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), in insects. A previous study showed that RNAi-mediated knockdown of SPO in Schistocerca gregaria last instar nymphs markedly reduced the hemolymph 20E titer, but did not affect metamorphosis. In the present study, the effects of SPO interference on development were re-examined in this locust. Injections of SPO double-stranded RNA (dsSPO) into nymphs at mid and late instars significantly delayed nymphal development and interfered with molting. The 20E levels of dsSPO-treated nymphs were generally low, with a delayed, small peak, suggesting that disturbance of the 20E levels caused the above developmental abnormalities. A small proportion of the dsSPO-injected nymphs metamorphosed precociously, producing adults and adultoids. Precocious adults were characterized by small body size, short wings with abbreviated venation, and normal reproductive activity. Fourth instar nymphs that precociously metamorphosed at the following instar exhibited temporal expression patterns of ecdysone-induced protein 93F and the juvenile hormone (JH) early-inducible gene Krüppel homolog 1 similar to those observed at the last instar in normal nymphs. Adultoids displayed mating behavior and adultoid females developed eggs, but never laid eggs. JH injection around the expected time of the 20E peak in the dsSPO-injected nymphs completely inhibited the appearance of adultoids, suggesting that appearance of adultoids might be due to a reduced titer of JH rather than of 20E. These results suggest that SPO plays an important role in controlling morphogenesis, metamorphosis, and reproduction in S. gregaria.\\n', 'The most common method used for minimizing the occurrence of diabetes complications is frequent glucose testing to adjust the insulin dose. However, using blood glucose (BG) meters presents a risk of infection. It is of great importance to develop non-invasive BG detection techniques. To realize high-accuracy, low-cost and continuous glucose monitoring, we have developed a non-invasive BG detection system using a mixed signal processor 430 (MSP430) microcontroller. This method is based on the combination of the conservation-of-energy method with a sensor integration module, which collects physiological parameters, such as the blood oxygen saturation (SPO 2 ), blood flow velocity and heart rate. New methods to detect the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and BV are proposed, which combine the human body heat balance and characteristic signals of photoplethysmography as well dual elastic chambers theory. Four hundred clinical trials on real-time non-invasive BG monitoring under suitable experiment conditions were performed on different individuals, including diabetic patients, senior citizens and healthy adults. A multisensory information fusion model was applied to process these samples. The algorithm (we defined it as DCBPN algorithm) applied in the model combines a decision tree and back propagation neural network, which classifies the physiological and environmental parameters into three categories, and then establishes a corresponding prediction model for the three categories. The DCBPN algorithm provides an accuracy of 88.53% in predicting the BG of new samples. Thus, this system demonstrates a great potential to reliably detect BG values in a non-invasive setting.\\n', 'Thiophosphate (SPO(3)) was recently shown to promote cysteine insertion at Sec (selenocysteine)-encoding UGA codons during selenoprotein synthesis. We reported previously that irreversible targeting by cDDP [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) or cisplatin] of the Sec residue in TrxR1 (thioredoxin reductase 1) contributes to cDDP cytotoxicity. This effect could possibly be attenuated in cells expressing less reactive Sec-to-cysteine-substituted TrxR1 variants, or pronounced in cells with higher levels of Sec-containing TrxR1. To test this, we supplemented cells with either SPO(3) or selenium and subsequently determined total as well as specific activities of cellular TrxR1, together with extent of drug-induced cell death. We found that cDDP became less cytotoxic after incubation of A549 or HCT116 cells with lower SPO(3) concentrations (100-300 μM), whereas higher SPO(3) (>300 μM) had pronounced direct cytotoxicity. NIH 3T3 cells showed low basal TrxR1 activity and high susceptibility to SPO(3) cytotoxicity, or to glutathione depletion. Supplementing NIH 3T3 cells with selenite, however, gave increased cellular TrxR1 activity with concomitantly decreased dependence on glutathione, whereas the susceptibility to cDDP increased. The results suggest molecular mechanisms by which the selenium status of cells can affect their glutathione dependence while modulating the cytotoxicity of drugs that target TrxR1.\\n', 'The role of organoselenium compounds as potent cancer chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents has been supported by epidemiological, preclinical and clinical studies. In this study, a novel selenadiazole derivative, 1,2,5-selenadiazolo-[3,4-d]pyrimidine-5,7-(4H,6H)-dione (SPO), is identified as a potent antiproliferative agent against human breast adrenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells, human hepatoma HepG2 cells and human melanoma A375 cells. Induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 and A375 cells by SPO was evidenced by accumulation of sub-G1 cell population, DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation. Further investigation on intracellular mechanisms found that SPO treatments induced activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9, overproduction of reactive oxygen species, and depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi m) through regulating the expression of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Our findings suggest that SPO is a promising novel organoselenium compound with potential in the treatment of human cancers.\\n', 'GnRH has been suggested to participate in corpus luteum function. Here we studied the expression of GnRH mRNA and peptide in two models of rat luteinized tissues: ovarian cells from PMSG-hCG treated prepubertal rats (SPO) and from intrasplenic ovarian tumors (Luteoma). A GnRH autoregulatory effect was evaluated as well as its action on cell proliferation and apoptosis. GnRH mRNA was present in SPO, isolated corpora lutea from SPO and Luteoma from 1 week to 7 months of development. In vitro cultures of Luteoma cells expressed 2-fold higher GnRH mRNA and 10-fold higher GnRH peptide than SPO cells. Buserelin (GnRH analog) increased GnRH mRNA and peptide expression in SPO but not in Luteoma cells. While basal proliferation was very low in Luteoma cells, SPO cells showed a significant increase in cell number by both the thymidine and the MTS methods after 72 h in culture. Buserelin induced a decrease in cell number in both cell types to a similar degree. Although basal apoptosis levels were higher in SPO than in Luteoma cells, Buserelin-induced apoptosis was only detected in Luteoma cells after 48 h treatment. These results show that the two types of rat, luteinized tissues, Luteoma and SPO, markedly differed in some intrinsic properties and in their local GnRH systems. Luteoma cells proliferate very weakly, express and secrete high amounts of GnRH, do not show an autoregulatory effect and respond to the decapeptide with apoptosis stimulation. In contrast SPO cells proliferate significantly, secrete low levels of GnRH but possess a positive, autoregulatory mechanism and respond to GnRH stimulation with impairment of proliferation.\\n', 'Effects of the salivary peroxidase (SPO) system on the growth, glucose uptake and metabolic activities of oral bacteria are well documented but the effects on oral fungi are virtually unknown. Therefore, the viability of Candida albicans (ATCC 28366) exposed to the peroxidase/SCN-/H2O2 system was studied in sterilized saliva, in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and in potassium chloride. The growth of C. albicans in glucose-supplemented saliva was faster at pH 5.5 than at pH 7. The addition of the complete SPO (or lactoperoxidase) system to either sterilized saliva, KCl (50 microM) or PBS at pH 5.5 inhibited dose-dependently the viability of C. albicans in KCl, but no inhibition was found in PBS or saliva. Maximal inhibition was achieved in 2 h and with > 320 microM of peroxidase-generated HOSCN/OSCN-. However, physiological salivary concentrations of phosphate (> or = 1.0 mM) and PBS blocked the antifungal effect of HOSCN/OSCN-. The relative proportions of SCN- and H2O2 were critical to the antifungal effects. With 0.2 mM KSCN, a complete loss of viability was achieved, though the HOSCN/OSCN- concentrations did not exceed 100 microM. It is concluded that C. albicans is sensitive to HOSCN/OSCN- but salivary concentrations of phosphate block the antifungal effect of the peroxidase systems.\\n', \"The Structured Preschool Participation Observation (SPO) for Children with ASD: Adaptation, Initial Psychometric Properties, and Children's Participation.\\nAims:  Due to the lack of tools evaluating participation of children with ASD in the educational setting, this study aimed to adapt the Structured Preschool Participation Observation (SPO), which assess the participation of preschool children attending mainstream-educational settings to children with ASD attending non-inclusive special education (content validity), to measure its initial psychometric properties (internal reliability, inter-rater reliability), and to describe children's participation characteristics, creating an effective tool to fill this gap. Methods:  Content validity was evaluated by 21 experts using questionnaires. Thirty-five children with ASD were observed in their educational setting using the adapted tool (SPO-ASD). Results:  Content validity was satisfactory regarding the items and their classification into occupational areas. Moderate to excellent internal consistency (α = .73-.92) and inter-rater reliability (ICC = .61-.95,  p <.05) were found for all scales and most areas. Children's participation frequency was high in learning and activities of daily living (ADL), low in play and social participation. Performance level was low in social participation. Enjoyment level was low, and needed assistance in ADL was high. Conclusions:  Based on our initial evaluation, the SPO-ASD may be suitable for assessing participation of children with ASD attending special education preschools. Additional studies are needed to more securely establish its psychometric properties.\\n\"])"

       "dict_values(['In mammals, peroxidases have some organ, tissue, cellular and sub-cellular specific distribution patterns, performing some specific functions. These peroxidases include, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), uterine peroxidase, lactoperoxidase (LPO), salivary peroxidase (SPO) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) (Klebanoff, 2005). These peroxidases play an important role in wide metabolic activities and are directly or indirectly involved in various diseases (Cheng et al., 2008).\\nDifferent harmful microorganisms enter the human body through the oral passage regularly. These bacteria are killed by the first line of defence system present in saliva, which includes salivary peroxidase (SPO) as the major peroxidase. Oral peroxidases OPO are composed of salivary peroxidase (80%) and MPO (20%) (Pruitt et al., 1990; Nagler et al., 2002). SPO inhibits both Gram-positive and Gram-negative oral and non-oral bacteria. In addition to this, SPO shows antiviral (Yamamoto et al., 1991; Chase & Klebanove, 1992; Mikola et al., 1995), and antifungal (MacCarthy & Dahl, 1989; Lenander-Lumikari, 1992) activities.\\n', '\\n                         Fig. 6A \\n                          depicts the competition curves between unlabelled steroid and [ 3 H]ALDO. The relative affinity obtained for each steroid is (EC 50  values in nM are given in parentheses): ALDO (2.3±0.3)=DOC (2.8±0.6)=CORT (3.1±0.6)>SC9420-spironolactone (SPO) (9.1±3.5)=PROG (15.1±7)>11-OP (43.2±3.0)≫6-OP and testosterone (T=O) (no significant binding).  Fig. 6B  depicts the dose–response curves for the steroids as urinary Na + /K +  ratio. Due to the combined protective action of several factors such as the activity of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  [10] , binding to transcortin and other plasma proteins  [38] , and/or the putative selectivity of the MR itself  [39] , the in vivo biological effect of CORT is impaired in spite of its high affinity for MR in the absence of those regulatory factors, as it is well known. Interestingly, the affinity of 11-OP is about 20-fold lower than the affinity of DOC for the MR, but the in vivo effect of 11-OP is as potent as that exhibited by DOC at low doses and even approaches that of ALDO at doses ≥10 μg. These observations confirm our previous reports  [27,31] . On the other hand, the antagonist steroids PROG and SPO, and the inactive steroids 6-OP and testosterone are very weak mineralocorticoids, if they are not totally inactive. It is interesting to emphasise that the maximum activity of 11-OP in transcription assays is as efficient as that measured for ALDO, CORT, cortisol and DOC (data not shown).\\nThe bar graph in  Fig. 6C  shows that ∼40% of the maximum mineralocorticoid effect can be measured using a suboptimal dose of 0.06 μg of ALDO. As expected, this effect was totally abolished by co-treatment with SPO and partially inhibited by co-treatment with PROG. Importantly, as low a dose of 11-OP as 0.6 ng, which is per se ineffective to promote any biological effect, potentiated the effect of 0.06 μg of ALDO, so that the maximal mineralocorticoid effect was reached. On the other hand, the inactive stereoisomer 6-OP does not affect the ALDO-dependent response.\\n\\n                         Fig. 7A \\n                          shows that the steroid binding capacity of cross-linked MR preincubated with vehicle (EtOH) was inhibited by further alkylation with PLP as compared to untreated control. The protective effect of the ligand on the PLP-dependent inactivation of cross-linked MR could be evidenced not only for ALDO, but also for DOC and CORT. On the other hand, when MR was prebound to the antagonists PROG and SPO, as well as the inactive ligands T=O and 6-OP, no protection was evidenced upon treatment with PLP followed by rebinding of [ 3 H]ALDO. Interestingly, the synthetic agonist 11-OP was also incapable of protecting the MR, demonstrating that the binding of 11-OP to the MR exhibits different properties with respect to natural agonists. It should be noted that identical results (not shown) were also obtained with TNBS-treated MR.\\n\\n                         Fig. 7B  depicts the MR inactivation rate upon treatment with PLP at different pH values. As shown in  Fig. 2C  for kidney cytosol, the maximal inactivation of unliganded receptor is reached at pH ≥9.0, suggesting the blockade of an ϵ-amino group. Similarly, steroids that do not exhibit binding properties to the MR such as testosterone and 6-OP were incapable of affecting the inactivation rate of the MR which is indistinguishable from the control. In contrast, the physiological agonists ALDO, DOC and CORT protected the MR from inactivation in the full range of pH values. Consistent with the notion that the binding of 11-OP to the MR is not equivalent to the binding of natural agonists, the synthetic agonist 11-OP shows a similar function as the inactive steroids at pH ≤8.0, but a partial protective action at higher pH values. Such an effect is clearly different from the observations obtained with both natural agonists and inactive steroids. Interestingly, a similar effect as that of 11-OP can be described for SPO and PROG, antagonistic steroids whose rate constants of inhibition are not distinguishable from the  K \\n                         i  obtained with 11-OP in the complete range of pH values assayed.\\nTaken together, these results demonstrate that the binding of natural agonists to the MR is comparable to neither the binding observed for 11-OP nor the binding of the antagonists SPO and PROG. Remarkably, 11-OP is not an antagonist, but an agonist that not only possesses mineralocorticoid effects per se but is also able to potentiate the ALDO biological effect.\\nThe rat MR possesses a total of 53 Lys residues, 18 of which are localised in the steroid binding domain  [40] . This led us to postulate that some lysyl groups may be essential for the binding of steroid to the MR. In this work, we provide evidence that this may be the case due to the substantial inhibition of hormone binding to MR upon modification of amino groups with PLP and TNBS. According to the data obtained in the experiment shown in  Fig. 5 , a stoichiometry equal to one Lys residue per molecule of receptor accounts for about a 70% inhibition of steroid binding. This suggests a critical role for only one lysyl group in the MR among those 53 total residues. Regardless of the exact location and number of residues modified by the treatment of the MR, the importance of this observation is that such inhibition is prevented if a natural agonist (i.e. ALDO, DOC or CORT) is bound to the receptor, but it is not protected upon antagonist binding (i.e. PROG or SPO). In this sense, the synthetic agonist 11-OP remarkably resembles the properties of antagonistic compounds rather than natural agonistic steroids ( Fig. 7 ).\\nWe have previously postulated that the synthetic steroid 11-OP may exert its biological effect by binding to an alternative site on the MR  [37] . Other possible biopharmacological properties that can account for 11-OP’s biological effect were studied and ruled out in a previous work  [27]  (i.e. a longer in vivo half-life, stronger in vivo binding to renal MR, non-genomic effects, etc.). In spite of the potent biological action of 11-OP, its protective effect against inactivation by PLP at high pH is just partial and closer to that observed with PROG and SPO ( Fig. 7B ). Again, this supports the notion that only agonists bound to the ALDO binding pocket with an appropriate orientation of the molecule are capable of fully protecting the amino group(s) from alkylating agents. A reasonable explanation for the differential protective effect observed with different ligands is the putative differential orientation of the ligand in the steroid binding pocket or its binding to a completely different binding site. Accordingly, a recent publication by Geller et al.  [44]  described cases of hypertension and pregnancy-related hypertension by a substitution of Leu 810  by Ser in the hMR. This substitution alters receptor specificity, where PROG, SPO and other 21-deoxysteroids become mineralocorticoids. Moreover, Auzou et al.  [45]  have reported that a mutant of hMR in Ala 773  also confers 11β-substituted spirolactones agonistic properties. Both mutations, Leu 810  and Ala 773 , are localised in the hormone binding domain of the MR.\\nIn this work, we also present evidence that a partial agonist/antagonist like PROG and an antagonist like SPO were incapable of protecting the MR at physiological pH, and only a partially protective effect was detected at alkaline pH for both compounds. The actual mechanism of action for SPO is still controversial. It was initially thought that SPO competitively inhibits ALDO binding to the MR and prevents its translocation to the nucleus  [46] . However, it was shown that SPO translocates into the nucleus associated to MR  [47]  and can bind to the DNA in vitro  [48] . Both processes seem to be less efficient than for ALDO. Recently, a cell-dependent partial agonistic activity of SPO was also reported  [49] . One possible explanation for these features may also be found in a differential positioning of SPO in the MR. Our results may be explained by a similar argument. In effect, even when SPO was present at saturating concentrations, only a minimal protective effect against the treatment with PLP could be evidenced, suggesting that the steroid can be placed in the ligand binding pocket, but has a different orientation of the steroid frame and/or functional groups. Therefore, modified lysyl groups required for ALDO binding remain exposed and, consequently, unprotected.\\n', 'Whereas many of the laboratory yeast strains sporulate poorly, the sporulation-proficient strain background SK1 can undergo premeiotic DNA replication and meiosis division with a certain degree of synchrony (Cha et al. 2000; Stuart 2008). Nevertheless, to study specific stages of sporulation or meiosis, a highly synchronous cell population is desirable, which led to the development of different strategies to further improve the synchrony of sporulation (Wan et al. 2006; Carlile and Amon 2008; Berchowitz et al. 2013). Previous work showed that expressing IME1 together with IME4 from the inducible CUP1 promoter (CUP-IME1 and CUP-IME4) drives cells to undergo gametogenesis more synchronously compared to wild-type SK1 (Berchowitz et al. 2013). For this procedure, cells were grown in rich medium (YPD) until saturation, shifted to presporulation medium (BYTA), then transferred to sporulation medium (SPO). Subsequently, cells were incubated in SPO for 2\\xa0hr before IME1 and IME4 were induced with copper (II) sulfate. We speculated that the timing of IME1 and IME4 induction in SPO could be an important factor in regulating sporulation, since the expression of these genes are tightly regulated (Chu et al. 1998; Primig et al. 2000; van Werven and Amon 2011). To examine this, we expressed IME1 and IME4 at different times, and quantified the percentage of cells that completed meiotic divisions for a series of time points (Figure 1A). From these data, we estimated the synchrony of meiotic divisions by computing the time or period taken for 75% of the cells to complete meiotic divisions (see Materials and Methods for details) (Figure 1, A and B). The shorter the time or period, the more synchronous the meiotic divisions. We also conducted a one-way ANOVA and a post hoc Tukey’s test to compare the effect of expressing IME1 and IME4 at different times on the period taken to complete meiotic divisions. The ANOVA showed that the effect of expressing IME1 and IME4 at different times was statistically significant, F(5,12)\\xa0=\\xa03.82, P\\xa0=\\xa00.0265. We observed an improvement in the synchrony of meiotic divisions significantly when IME1 and IME4 were induced at 2\\xa0hr after shifting to SPO instead of at 0\\xa0hr (4.19\\xa0hr compared to 2.21\\xa0hr, P\\xa0=\\xa00.0112) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, inducing IME1 and IME4 either earlier or later resulted did not improve the synchrony significantly (P\\xa0>\\xa00.05), suggesting that there is an optimal period to induce the two master regulators. The differences in kinetics cannot be explained by Ime1 and Ime4 protein levels since they were comparable between the different samples (Figure 1C). In conclusion, our result shows that the timing of IME1 and IME4 induction in sporulation medium contributes to synchronous meiotic divisions.\\nSynchronous sporulation requires specific timing of IME1 and IME4 induction. (A) Kinetics of meiotic divisions in diploid cells harboring CUP1 promoter fusions with IME1 and IME4 (pCUP-IME1/pCUP-IME4) (FW1810). Cells were grown overnight in rich medium (YPD), diluted to presporulation medium (BYTA), and grown for another 16\\xa0hr. Subsequently cells were transferred to sporulation medium (SPO), and IME1 and IME4 were induced at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6\\xa0hr in SPO. Samples were collected at 4\\xa0hr after induction up to 12\\xa0hr with a 1-hr interval, fixed in ethanol, nuclei were stained with DAPI, and DAPI masses were counted. Cells that harbored two, three, or four DAPI masses were classified as cells undergoing meiosis\\xa0I or meiosis\\xa0II (% MI\\xa0+\\xa0MII, y-axis). For each time point, at least 200 cells were counted. The time after IME1/IME4 induction is plotted on the x-axis. From each time course experiment, we also computed the time or period taken for 75% of the cells to complete meiotic divisions (see Materials and Methods for details). This number is displayed in brackets next to the legend, and represents the mean number of hours from three independent experiments followed by the SEM. (B) Graph to illustrate how we determined the time or period taken to complete meiotic divisions when IME1 and IME4 were induced at 0 or 2\\xa0hr after shifting cells to SPO medium as described in (A). A linear trend line was fitted from the first time point where meiotic divisions were detected, to the time point where 75% or more of the cells completed meiotic divisions. From the function, we calculated the period or time taken for 75% of the cells to complete meiotic divisions (MI/II). (C) Western blot showing Ime1 and Ime4 protein levels in cells described in (A). Samples were taken at 2\\xa0hr after inducing IME1 and IME4. Ime1 and Ime4 levels were detected by anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies. We also measured Ime1 and Ime4 in an untagged control (FW1511), and in cells that contain HA-tagged IME1 (FW2444), or IME4 (FW2480) alone. To control for loading, Hxk1 levels were also determined.\\nEfficient IME1 transcription requires glucose and nitrogen starvation, and the presence of a nonfermentable carbon source in the growth medium (Kassir et al. 1988). To obtain high levels of IME1 in SPO, cells are usually pregrown in acetate-containing medium. In contrast, induction of transcription from the CUP1 promoter requires solely the presence of copper ions in the medium. If variability in the onset of meiotic divisions is dependent largely on IME1 and IME4 levels, then pregrowth in acetate-containing medium should be dispensable when entry into sporulation is induced from the CUP1 promoter. Hence, we tested if the pCUP-IME1/pCUP-IME4 system can induce gametogenesis synchronously when cells were pregrown in glucose containing medium (YPD), and shifted to SPO directly (Figure 2A). To ensure that all cells were arrested as unbudded cells, we grew cells in YPD with reduced glucose (1% w/v instead of 2% w/v) for 16–18\\xa0hr. Whereas the majority of cells were budding when grown in medium with standard glucose levels, the reduced glucose condition enriched for unbudded cells (∼90%) after an overnight culture (Figure 2B). Cells pregrown in YPD or BYTA also gave rise to viable spores (Figure 2C). Next, we shifted cells to SPO medium, incubated cells for 2\\xa0hr, subsequently induced IME1 and IME4 with copper (II) sulfate, and measured the kinetics of meiotic S-phase and meiotic divisions. We observed that cells pregrown in BYTA or YPD both completed premeiotic DNA replication in ∼60\\xa0min (Figure 2D). Remarkably, in the YPD to SPO condition, the DNA profile showed intermediate peaks for several time points (between 2C and 4C) indicating that the population of cells underwent DNA replication with a high degree of synchrony (Figure 2D). When the cells were pregrown in BYTA, these intermediate peaks were less pronounced. In addition, we also measured the rate of meiotic divisions, and found the majority of cells completed meiotic divisions within comparable periods in both conditions (Figure 2E). We conducted a two-tailed t-test, and found that the time taken to complete meiotic divisions under both conditions was not statistically significantly different (P\\xa0>\\xa00.05). Overall, our results show that synchronous DNA replication and meiotic divisions can be induced from cells precultured until saturation in nutrient-rich medium containing glucose.\\nCells do not require growth in acetate-containing medium prior to induction of synchronous sporulation. (A) Flowchart for inducing synchronous sporulation. Diploid pCUP-IME1/pCUP-IME4 (FW1810) cells were grown to exponential phase for 6–7\\xa0hr in YPD. Cells were subsequently diluted to YPD medium with 1% glucose and grown for 16–18\\xa0hr to an OD600 of 11–12 to obtain mostly unbudded G1 cells. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, washed with sterile water and resuspended to a final OD600 of 2.5 in SPO; 50\\xa0µM copper\\xa0(II) sulfate was added 2\\xa0hr after the cells were transferred to SPO to induce IME1 and IME4.

Copper\\xa0(II) sulfate was added 2\\xa0hr after the cells were transferred to SPO.

The graph displays a representative experiment from three repeated experiments. *, time of induction of IME1, 2\\xa0hr after the cells were transferred to SPO.\\nWe also examined whether the composition of SPO medium influences the synchrony of meiotic divisions of cells pregrown in YPD. To do so, we increased the level of acetate in SPO from 0.3 to 1.0% w/v, and the medium was supplemented with amino acids and adenine (see Materials and Methods for details). Cells started meiotic divisions slightly earlier when using the supplemented SPO instead of the regular SPO (Figure 2F). Hence, we decided to use the supplemented SPO for the experiments described in the remainder of the manuscript.\\nInduction of IME1 is sufficient to induce gametogenesis synchronously. (A) Kinetics of meiotic divisions in wild-type cells (FW1511), cells harboring IME1 and IME4 fused to the CUP1 promoter (pCUP-IME1/pCUP-IME4) (FW1810), pCUP-IME1 (FW2444), or pCUP-IME4 (FW2480). Cells were grown overnight in YPD, and shifted to SPO (1.0% w/v potassium acetate supplemented with adenine, uracil, and amino acids); 50\\xa0µM copper\\xa0(II) sulfate was added 2\\xa0hr after the cells were transferred to SPO. Samples were taken at the indicated time point, fixed in ethanol, nuclei were stained with DAPI, and DAPI masses were counted.

The average result and the SEM of three independent experiments is shown. *, time of induction.\\nThe observation that temporal expression of IME1, but not of IME4, generates a high degree of synchrony during DNA replication and meiotic divisions, prompted us to revisit how the two genes regulate each other. We hypothesized that IME1 directly or indirectly regulates IME4 expression. To examine this possibility, we measured IME4 transcript levels in cells harboring pCUP-IME1 in the presence or absence of copper (II) sulfate. As expected, IME1 transcript levels increased when copper ions were added to the SPO medium (Figure 4A). Since IME4 is also regulated by an antisense transcript, we specifically quantified IME4 sense mRNA using a transcript-specific primer in the reverse transcription reaction (Hongay et al. 2006; Gelfand et al. 2011). We found that IME4 transcript levels significantly increased when IME1 was induced, suggesting that Ime1 stimulates IME4 transcription (Figure 4B). Data from a genome-wide study indicated that IME4 is regulated directly by the repressor Ume6 (Williams et al. 2002). During early sporulation, Ime1 interacts with Ume6 to form a transcription-activating complex for the expression of early meiotic genes (Bowdish et al. 1995; Rubin-Bejerano et al. 1996). To test whether Ume6 indeed binds the IME4 promoter, we identified the canonical URS1 motif (TAGGCGGC) sequence at −234 bp upstream in the IME4 promoter. More importantly, we found that Ume6 was bound directly to the IME4 promoter, as shown by ChIP (Figure 4C). In conclusion, our results show that IME1 directly regulates the expression of IME4, explaining why IME1 can single-handedly induce synchronous sporulation. These results also suggest that IME1 and IME4 act in a positive feedback loop to stimulate the expression of each other.\\nIME1 directly regulates the expression of IME4. (A) Induction of IME1 promotes IME4 expression. Diploid cells harboring pCUP-IME1 (FW2444) were transferred to SPO. Cells were either untreated (control) or treated with copper\\xa0(II) sulfate (induced), and samples were collected at different time points. Total RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, and IME1 (left panel) or IME4 (right panel) mRNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR. To quantify IME4 levels, primers specific for the IME4 and ACT1 sense strand were used in the reverse transcription reaction. Signals were normalized to ACT1 levels. The values and error bars represent two independent experiments. (B) Ume6 binds to the promoter of IME4. Diploid cells harboring Ume6 tagged with the V5 epitope (FW1208) and a wild-type control strain (FW1511) were grown in YPD to saturation. Cells were fixed with formaldehyde, and cells were processed for ChIP analyses (see Materials and Methods for details). DNA fragments specific to the IME4 promoter (pIME4) were amplified and quantified by qPCR. Signals were normalized to the HMR locus. The error bars represent the SE of at least three experiments. *, time of induction of IME1—2 hr after the cells were transferred to SPO.\\nDifferent genetic approaches have been used to synchronize cells at different stages of sporulation (Benjamin et al. 2003; Wan et al. 2006; Carlile and Amon 2008). One approach makes use of controlled expression of the transcription factor NDT80, and, as a result, cells undergo meiotic divisions synchronously (Benjamin et al. 2003; Carlile and Amon 2008). The Ndt80 transcription factor promotes the expression of numerous genes that regulate meiotic divisions, also known as middle genes (Xu et al. 1995; Chu et al. 1998). Effective induction of NDT80 is achieved by controlling its expression from the GAL1 promoter (pGAL-NDT80) and the transcription factor GAL4-ER, consisting of the Gal4 DNA binding domain fused to the estrogen receptor binding domain. In the presence of β-estradiol, pGAL-NDT80 cells induce NDT80, and exit from pachytene arrest to undergo meiotic divisions (Benjamin et al. 2003; Carlile and Amon 2008). The pGAL-NDT80 system specifically synchronizes meiotic divisions during gametogenesis, but, unlike the pCUP-IME1 system, this method does not synchronize the events prior to meiotic chromosome segregation. To examine whether it is possible to combine the pCUP-IME1 system with the pGAL-NDT80 system, we generated a diploid strain with both synchronization systems. The early and middle stages of sporulation were initiated by IME1 at 2\\xa0hr, and NDT80 at 6\\xa0hr, after shifting cells to SPO, respectively (Figure 5A). We found that the pCUP-IME1 and pGAL-NDT80 cells had a similar degree of synchrony of meiotic divisions (Figure 5B). The pCUP-IME1/pGAL-NDT80 strain showed a minor improvement in synchrony, which was not statistically significant (P\\xa0>\\xa00.05), when compared to cells expressing pCUP-IME1 or pGAL-NDT80 alone (1.18\\xa0hr compared to 1.63 and 1.63\\xa0hr) (Figure 5B). We observed a similar trend when we examined meiosis\\xa0I and meiosis\\xa0II divisions separately, showing that the pCUP-IME1 or pGAL-NDT80 systems can be combined (Figure 5C). With the pCUP-IME1/pGAL-NDT80 system, we can synchronize cells at the level of premeiotic DNA replication until completion of meiotic divisions, with the added advantage of being able to control entry into the early and middle stages of gametogenesis.\\npCUP-IME1 system can be combined with the pGAL-NDT80 system to improve synchrony of sporulation. (A) Scheme of experimental setup. The diploid cells harboring IME1 fused to CUP promoter (FW2444), NDT80 expressed from the GAL promoter together with Gal4 fused to the estrogen receptor (GAL4.ER pGAL-NDT80) (FW1541) or a strain expressing both (pCUP-IME1 and GAL4.ER pGAL-NDT80) (FW2795) were grown in YPD overnight. Cells harboring GAL4.ER GAL-NDT80 (FW1541) were transferred to presporulation medium (BYTA). Subsequently, cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with sterile water and resuspended to a final OD600 of 2.5 in SPO; 50\\xa0µM copper\\xa0(II) sulfate was added 2\\xa0hr after the cells were transferred to SPO, and 1\\xa0µM β-estradiol was added 6\\xa0hr after transfer to SPO. (B) Kinetics of meiotic divisions in strains, using procedures described in (A). Samples were taken at the indicated time points, fixed in ethanol, nuclei were stained with DAPI, and DAPI masses were counted. Cells that harbored two, three, or four DAPI masses were classified as cells undergoing meiosis\\xa0I or meiosis\\xa0II (% MI\\xa0+\\xa0MII). For each time point, at least 200 cells were counted. We also computed the time or period taken for 75% of the cells to complete meiotic divisions (see Materials and Methods for details). This number is displayed in brackets next to the legend, and represents the mean number of hours followed by the SEM of three independent experiments. (C) Similar to B except that the percentages of bi- (left panel), or tri- and tetra-nucleate (right panel) cells (n\\xa0=\\xa0200 cells) of strains described in (A) were determined. *, time of IME1 induction; **, time of NDT80 induction.\\nOur data indicate that induction of synchronous sporulation requires a specified timing of IME1 induction. Interestingly, in wild-type cells, the IME1 promoter, like in synchronous sporulation, is active at 2\\xa0hr after shifting to sporulation medium (Inai et al. 2007; Nachman et al. 2007). Given that nutrient availability is an important trigger for IME1 and sporulation, perhaps nutrients also control timing of sporulation after IME1 induction (Jambhekar and Amon 2008; van Werven and Amon 2011) . Inducing IME1 too late could affect sporulation, because cells have been starved for prolonged times, whereas inducing IME1 too early does not result in optimal sporulation because cells are not ready. In line with this hypothesis, in a recent report we showed that a certain level of nutrient-sensing target of rapamycin complex (TORC1) activity is needed for sporulation (Weidberg et al. 2016). Too much or too little TORC1 affects sporulation negatively. Perhaps, TORC1 activity is most optimal for synchronous sporulation at 2\\xa0hr in SPO. Another explanation is that downstream targets of IME1 are not properly activated because the meiosis promoting kinases Rim11 and Rim15 are not active (Bowdish et al. 1994; Rubin-Bejerano et al. 1996; Vidan and Mitchell 1997; Pedruzzi et al. 2003; Sarkar et al. 2014). This can explain why inducing IME1 too early did not result in synchronous sporulation, but cannot explain the reduced synchrony when IME1 is induced too late. More work is needed to pinpoint why timing of IME1 expression is critical for synchronous sporulation.\\n', 'Mossy fiber boutons are also selectively marked by the presynaptic vesicle-associated protein synaptoporin (SPO; also called synaptophysin 2) (Singec et al., 2002). We found that TTX markedly increased SPO immunoreactivity along proximal but not distal dendrites (Figure 5C–D) (proximal: NT 1.0±0.37, TTX 4.0±1.2, P<0.05; distal: NT 0.34±0.12, TTX 0.62±0.19, P=0.24). The TTX-induced proximal cluster synapses labeled with PSD-95 were apposed to particularly large puncta immunoreactive for SPO (Figure 5C, insets), indicating that inactivity promotes presynaptic MF elaboration opposite proximal TE expansion in CA3 cells.\\nWe hypothesized that the increase in AMPAR-mEPSC frequency after TTX treatment was due to selective upregulation of MF-CA3 synapses. We therefore performed a synaptotagmin uptake assay to determine presynaptic release at SPO-positive terminals. While TTX treatment again increased proximal SPO levels (Figure S5A–B), inactivity did not significantly increase either proximal or distal synaptotagmin levels (TTX proximal: 131.7±17.9% of NT proximal; TTX distal: 41.8±4.8% of NT distal; Figure S5A,C). However, TTX treatment caused a massive redistribution of synaptotagmin to SPO-positive boutons (NT proximal: 31.8±5.3% synaptotagmin colocalization with SPO, TTX proximal: 80.9±3.7%; NT distal: 16.6±4.4%, TTX distal: 52.0±8.7%; P<0.01; Figure S5A,D), suggesting that inactivity reallocates presynaptic efficacy towards MF-CA3 synapses as has been observed in organotypic slice culture (Kim and Tsien, 2008; Mitra et al., 2012).\\nHippocampal MF synapses are the most powerful hippocampal synapses known (Henze et al., 1997; Jonas et al., 1993), making it possible that the inactivity-induced increase in AMPAR-mEPSC amplitude was due to selective increases in presynaptic release from these terminals. We therefore quantified the number of large amplitude mEPSCs (>95th percentile amplitude value for control neurons, 20 pA) recorded before and after mGluR2 activation, which is known to block MF transmission in acute slice (Mellor and Nicoll, 2001). Using the synaptotagmin uptake assay to validate the in vitro MF blockade, we found that acute mGluR2 agonist application decreased the colocalization of synaptotagmin with SPO in both proximal and distal dendrites (Figure S5D). Acute MF blockade with mGluR2 agonists LY487379 (5 µM) or DCGIV (10 µM, data not shown) significantly decreased the number of large amplitude mEPSCs observed in TTX-treated neurons (events/minute: baseline, 58.2±21.8; LY487379, 23.5±11.8, P=0.032, paired t-test vs. baseline), without altering the number of small amplitude events (<20 pA) (Figure 5E–F, S5E). MF blockade also abolished the significant differences in mEPSC amplitude observed with homeostatic adaptation (in pA, baseline: NT 8.5±0.92, TTX 11.5±1.0, PTX 6.1±0.52; P<0.01, one-way ANOVA; LY487379: NT 8.1±0.86, TTX 10.0±0.67, PTX 6.9±1.2; P=0.08) (Figure 5G), suggesting that changes in MF transmission largely account for the observed homeostatic changes in amplitude.\\nTo confirm that SPO-positive MF terminals innervate CA3 neurons in vitro, we immunostained GFP-transfected neurons with PSD-95 and the CA3-specific marker, Py. SPO-positive boutons from GFP-transfected DG neurons preferentially targeted Py-positive CA3 cells (~80 %; Figure S6A–B), reflecting a high specificity of DG-CA3 synaptic connections in culture.\\nTo test the requirement of MF upregulation for inactivity-induced TE formation, we used RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of SPO (validated in Figure S6C–E). Neurons were transfected with control vector (pLL3.7), SPO-shRNA, or SPO-shRNA with an RNAi-insensitive SPO rescue construct for 2 days before 24 hr of TTX treatment. MF axonal processes from GFP-expressing DG neurons were traced to identify the postsynaptic contacts of SPO-positive terminals (Figure 6A, Figure S6A–B, F). Following TTX treatment, MF boutons (circles in Figure 6A) contacted the large PSD-95 immunoreactive puncta in proximal CA3 dendrites. SPO knockdown in presynaptic MF terminals abolished TTX-mediated enlargement of apposed PSD-95 puncta, while coexpression of SPO-shRNA and SPO rescue constructs restored the TTX-induced increase in PSD-95 puncta intensity in proximal CA3 synapses (Figure 6A–C) (pLL3.7 1.0±0.11; pLL3.7+TTX 1.8±0.28; SPO shRNA 0.4±0.06; SPO shRNA+TTX 0.6±0.08; SPO shRNA+rescue 1.8±0.22; SPO shRNA+rescue+TTX 2.4±0.34; P<0.05, one-way ANOVA and Tukey test). SPO knockdown and rescue had no effect on MF bouton size, however (Figure 6C) (pLL3.7 1.1±0.09 µm2; pLL3.7+TTX 1.2±0.08; SPO shRNA 1.2±0.13; SPO shRNA+TTX 1.1±0.08; SPO shRNA+rescue 1.0±0.09; SPO shRNA+rescue+TTX 0.9±0.09; P>0.15, one-way ANOVA). Together, these findings suggest that Spo function is required for inactivity-induced upregulation of presynaptic MF function and subsequent expansion of postsynaptic TE, but not for structural enlargement of MF terminals.\\nWe next examined the functional consequences of SPO knockdown and rescue by recording AMPAR-mEPSCs from the postsynaptic targets of GFP-expressing DG neurons. TTX treatment induced a significant increase in both mEPSC amplitude and frequency in DG targets (Figure 6D–F) (pLL3.7: 17.2±0.34 pA, 9.5±1.6 Hz; pLL3.7+TTX: 23.0±1.4 pA, 19.9±1.8 Hz; P<0.01 vs. pLL3.7, one-way ANOVA and Tukey test). SPO knockdown in presynaptic DG cells prevented the TTX-induced increase in both mEPSC amplitude and frequency (SPO shRNA: 16.3±0.4 pA, 9.6±0.8 Hz; SPO shRNA+TTX: 16.9±0.4 pA, 12.0±1.3 Hz, P>0.05 vs. pLL3.7, ++ P<0.01 vs. pLL3.7+TTX), while SPO rescue was sufficient to elevate mEPSC amplitude and frequency to TTX levels (Figure 6D–F) (SPO shRNA+rescue: 22.1±0.6 pA, 17.8±1.9 Hz; SPO shRNA+rescue+TTX: 21.1±1.7 pA, 23.2±3.4 Hz; P<0.05 vs. pLL3.7, P>0.05 vs. pLL3.7+TTX). Taken together, these results indicate that presynaptic SPO is necessary and sufficient for the homeostatic upregulation of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses.\\n', 'The ecdysteroid biosynthesis in the prothoracic glands (PGs) begins from conversion of cholesterol into 7-dehydrocholesterol (7dC), mediated by a Rieske oxygenase Neverland[13,14]. The conversion of 7dC into 2,22,25-trideoxyecdysone (ketodiol) is a series of hypothetical and unproven reactions, and is called ‘Black Box’ [15]. In Drosophila melanogaster and Bombyx mori, CYP307A1/A2 (SPOOK/SPOOKIER, SPO/SPOK) [16,17] and CYP6T3 [18] have been proven to be involved in the ‘Black Box’. Moreover, a paralog SPOOKIEST (SPOT, CYP307B1) was also found in CYP307 family [16,17]. RNAi mediated knockdown of spok in the PGs results in arrest of molting in D. melanogaster. Feeding two 3-oxo steroids, cholesta-4,7-diene-3,6-dione-14α-ol (Δ4-diketol) and 5β [H]cholesta-7-ene-3,6-dione-14a-ol (diketol), in the RNAi-treated larvae triggered molting, enhanced amounts of ecdysteroids and induced 20E inducible genes [19]. These results indicate that Δ4-diketol and diketol are components of the ecdysteroid biosynthetic pathway and lie downstream of a step catalyzed by SPOK/SPO. SPO- and/or SPOK-like proteins had found in other insect species in Diptera such as Bemisia tabaci[20], in Coleoptera such as the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum[21], in Hymenoptera such as Apis mellifera[22], in Lepidoptera such as Spodoptera littoralis[23], Manduca sexta[17] and Holcocerus hippophaecolus[24], in Orthoptera such as Schistocerca gregaria[25], and in Hemiptera such as Acyrthosiphon pisum[26]. Up to now, however, involvement of SPO in ecdysteroidogenesis has not been confirmed in other insect species except D. melanogaster and B. mori.\\nAlignment of CYP307A1 (SPOOK, SPO) sequences from five insect species.\\u2009SPO originates from Manduca sexta\\u2009(Ms) (ABI74778), Drosophila melanogaster\\u2009(Dm) (NP_647975), Tribolium castaneum\\u2009(Tc) (XP_969587), Acyrthosiphon pisum\\u2009(Ap) (XP_001946295) and Sogatella furcifera (Sf), respectively. Amino acids with 100%, 80%, and 60% conservation are shaded in black, dark grey and light grey. The characteristic P450 structure, membrane targeting hydrophobic segment, P/G rich domain, Helix C, Helix I, Helix K, PERF motif and Heme-binding domain are shown in the figure.\\nSPO sequence is similar to those from other insects. Insect CYPs have five insect conserved P450 motifs, i.e., WxxxR (Helix-C), GxE/DTT/S (Helix-I), ExxR (Helix-K), PxxFxPE/DRF (PERF motif) and PFxxGxRxCxG/A (heme-binding domain), where ‘x’ means any amino acid [40]. For SfSPO, Helix-C and Helix-I are not conserved. Helix-C had the amino acid sequence of H/YxxPR, and the amino acid sequence of Helix-I was GGHSA/V (Figure\\xa01).\\nIn insects, SPO belongs to CYP2 family. The N-terminus of SfSPO has one of the common characters in microsomal P450s, consisting many hydrophobic residues followed by a proline/glycine (P/G) rich region (Figure\\xa01).\\nSince the fundamental phenomena such as molting and metamorphosis are conserved during arthropod evolution, the Halloween genes are expected to be well conserved in insects [23,25,26,41-44], and in other arthropods [1,45]. In the present paper, the presence of Sfspo was demonstrated in S. furcifera. The primary structure of SfSPO has three insect conserved P450 motifs, i.e., Helix-K, PERF and heme-binding motifs. Similar structural characters have been documented in SPO- and SPOK-like proteins from other insect species of diverse orders such as Diptera [16,17,20], Coleoptera [21], Hymenoptera [22], Lepidoptera [17,23], Orthoptera [25], and Hemiptera [26]. The N-terminus of SfSPO has one of the common characters in microsomal P450s, consisting many hydrophobic residues followed by a proline/glycine (P/G) rich region. Consistent with the structural features, SPO is detected in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when the corresponding gene is transfected to Drosophila S2 cells [17,46]. Moreover, Sfspo showed three expression peaks in late second-, third- and fourth-instar stages. In contrast, the expression levels were lower and formed three troughs in the newly-molted second-, third- and fourth-instar nymphs. In the fourth-instar nymphs of the brown planthopper N. lugens[47] and in the sixth-instar larvae of a lepidopteran species S. littoralis, the level of ecdysteroid showed a peak in the later instar stage. In D. melanogaster larval stage, expression patterns of Dmspo gene undergoes dramatic fluctuations, consistent with circulating ecdysteroid quantity in the haemolymph: being high in late seconds, low in early third and high in late thirds [17]. Furthermore, we found in this study that Sfspo clearly had a high transcript level in the thorax where PGs were located. Similarly, Dmspo is expressed primarily in the PG cells of the ring gland in larval and adult stages [17]. Thus, the structural features and temporal and spatial expression patterns suggest that SfSPO might be involved in the ecdysteroidogenesis in S. furcifera.\\nRaw nucleotide reads of S. furcifera were downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database with its accession number SRP009194, and assembled into unigenes using Trinity software [56]. The annotated SPO from 4 representative insect species A. pisum, T. castaneum, M. sexta and D. melanogaster were downloaded from NCBI reference sequences (RefSeq) database. These protein sequences were used for TBLASTN searches of S. furcifera transcriptome data to identify hits at a cutoff E-value of 1.0-5. The nucleotide sequences of hits resulting from initial searches were annotated by blasting (BLASTX, e-values\\u2009<\\u200910-5) against a local protein database containing NCBI non-redundant proteins.\\nAfter full-length cDNA was obtained, we designed primers (Table\\xa01) to verify the complete ORF with the same PCR conditions outlined above. ORF was predicted using the editseq program of DNAStar (http://www.dnastar.com) and the features of the protein were determined by TargetP. The resulting sequence was submitted to GenBank (KC579454). The annotated SPO-like proteins from the 4 representative insect species mentioned above were aligned with the predicted LsSPOK using ClustalW2.1 [58].\\n', 'Provision of supplemental oxygen to maintain soft tissue viability acutely following trauma in which vascularization has been compromised would be beneficial for limb and tissue salvage. For this application, an oxygen generating biomaterial that may be injected directly into the soft tissue could provide an unprecedented treatment in the acute trauma setting. The purpose of the current investigation was to determine if sodium percarbonate (SPO), an oxygen generating biomaterial, is capable of maintaining resting skeletal muscle homeostasis under otherwise hypoxic conditions. In the current studies, a biologically and physiologically compatible range of SPO (1–2 mg/mL) was shown to: 1) improve the maintenance of contractility and attenuate the accumulation of HIF1α, depletion of intramuscular glycogen, and oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation) that occurred following ∼30 minutes of hypoxia in primarily resting (duty cycle\\u200a=\\u200a0.2 s train/120 s contraction interval <0.002) rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles in vitro (95% N2–5% CO2, 37°C); 2) attenuate elevations of rat EDL muscle resting tension that occurred during contractile fatigue testing (3 bouts of 25 100 Hz tetanic contractions; duty cycle\\u200a=\\u200a0.2 s/2 s\\u200a=\\u200a0.1) under oxygenated conditions in vitro (95% O2–5% CO2, 37°C); and 3) improve the maintenance of contractility (in vivo) and prevent glycogen depletion in rat tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in a hindlimb ischemia model (i.e., ligation of the iliac artery). Additionally, injection of a commercially available lipid oxygen-carrying compound or the components (sodium bicarbonate and hydrogen peroxide) of 1 mg/mL SPO did not improve EDL muscle contractility under hypoxic conditions in vitro. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that a biological and physiological concentration of SPO (1–2 mg/mL) injected directly into rat skeletal muscle (EDL or TA muscles) can partially preserve resting skeletal muscle homeostasis under hypoxic conditions.\\nA novel class of oxygen-generating biomaterials represents a viable solution for the direct provision of oxygen to hypoxic skeletal muscle in the event of compromised blood flow. Specifically, sodium percarbonate (SPO) is a fast-releasing oxygen compound that appears promising for tissue salvage applications. SPO is an adduct of sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide that, in the presence of water, readily decomposes into oxygen, water, and other salts. Previously, SPO has been used in commercial applications as a rich source of oxygen, such as in soil remediation to improve bacteria viability [14], as well as a cleaning agent for teeth [15], [16]. In addition, this material has also been used successfully as a therapeutic agent for skin wound healing in a mouse skin flap model by delaying the onset of necrosis up to 3 days and decreasing cellular apoptosis [17]. However, oxygen-generating compounds, including SPO, have not been tested specifically for skeletal muscle applications.\\nThe purpose of the current investigation was to determine if SPO could support skeletal muscle metabolism under hypoxic conditions, using the loss of contractility as a primary index of loss of metabolic homeostasis [25], [26]. To do so, we report a series of studies that encompass characterizing the SPO biomaterial in a cell-free environment (Study One) to testing identified biologically and physiologically compatible concentrations of SPO in skeletal muscle under hypoxic or ischemic conditions in vitro (Study Two) and in vivo (Study Three), respectively. Collectively, the findings of these studies demonstrate that SPO (1 mg/mL) represents a biocompatible oxygen-generating material capable of partially supporting skeletal muscle homeostasis under otherwise hypoxic/ischemic conditions.\\nA series of three studies was performed to establish SPO as an effective treatment for hypoxic skeletal muscle. In Study One, SPO biomaterial characteristics (e.g., pH changes, free radical production, and oxygen generation) were determined in a physiological cell-free system. In Study Two, SPO biocompatibility and its ability to maintain skeletal muscle homeostasis under hypoxic conditions in vitro was determined. To assess biocompatibility, C2C12 cell viability and isolated rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle contractility assays were performed across a range of SPO concentrations under oxygen-saturated conditions (ambient air or 95% O2, 5% CO2, respectively). Upon determining a biocompatible SPO concentration (1 mg/mL) for this model, the capacity of SPO to maintain EDL muscle homeostasis in vitro under resting hypoxic conditions and during an active fatigue protocol was determined. Finally, in Study Three, SPO was tested as a tissue salvage treatment in vivo in a rat model of hindlimb ischemia.\\nTheoretical Determination of a Therapeutic Concentration of SPO\\nThe goal of this study was to supply enough oxygen via SPO decomposition to at least maintain resting skeletal muscle metabolism at 37°C. Oxygen consumption for rat EDL muscle has previously been reported to be ≈0.06 µL/g/s at rest at 23–37°C [18], [19]. For the EDL muscles used in this study, which weigh, on average, approximately 130 mg, it is assumed that during the course of a 30-minute organ bath contractile protocol (described below) with a duty cycle approximating 0, the muscle will consume approximately 14.0 µL of oxygen in a resting state. The following equations were used to determine the concentration of SPO required to produce a comparable volume of oxygen:\\nSPO decomposes to generate oxygen according to the following equation:(2)\\nThe amount of SPO needed to generate the theoretical value for oxygen required by the resting rat EDL is:(3)\\nThe volume of solution administered to the tissue in vitro was selected as 20 µL: a volume that did not diminish in vitro force production (Figure S1). Concentrations of SPO solutions tested either in cell culture or in vitro contractility experiments included 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 mg/mL to determine toxicity, physiological compatibility and efficacy of SPO. Isolated EDL contractility experimental muscles received a total of 0.002, 0.02, 0.1, and 0.2 mg SPO– a range that encompassed the requirement of oxygen to maintain resting metabolism under these conditions (Eq. 3).\\nStudy I: Characterization of SPO Biomaterial in a Cell-free System\\nSodium percarbonate (SPO) was cryogenically ground (Freezer/Mill®, SPEX SamplePrep) for 30 minutes and sifted through a 25 µm mesh sieve to obtain a homogenous distribution of small particles. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Model S-2260N, Hitachi Co. Ltd., Japan) was performed to observe the particle size and confirm uniform diameters.\\nSPO was added to a physiologically relevant solution of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco®) at 0, 1 and 10 mg/mL, and oxygen generation, pH changes, and hydrogen peroxide production were measured (n\\u200a=\\u200a3). An Oxygen Biosensor System (OBS, 96-well plate, Becton Dickinson™) was used to determine oxygen concentration (mg/L) per the manufacturer’s guidelines. Briefly, samples in triplicate were placed in the wells, and the OBS plate was kept in a hypoxic glovebox system (Biospherix, Ltd.) set to ∼0% O2, 5% CO2. Fluorescence intensity of the OBS plate was read on a fluorometer (Molecular Devices, Spectramax M5; 485 nm excitation, 630 nm emission). Readings were correlated to fluorescence intensities of known dissolved oxygen concentrations of DMEM solutions obtained by incubating solutions under calibrated oxygen settings in incubators. pH measurements of solutions in 15 mL conical tubes were made using a pH probe (Accumet®, Fisher). Hydrogen peroxide content was quantified using an Amplex® Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Kit (Invitrogen®) [27]. Fluorescence was measured using a fluorometer (545 nm excitation, 590 nm emission). Oxygen, pH and peroxide measurements were taken periodically, up to 24 hours.\\nStudy II: In vitro Analysis of SPO\\nViability studies were performed to test cytocompatibility of SPO at concentrations later used in tissue studies. Murine myoblasts (C2C12, passage 5) were cultured in complete growth medium (DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin), plated at 3,000 cells/well in a 96-well tissue culture-treated plate and allowed to adhere for 24 hours in a 37°C humidified atmosphere of 20% O2 – 5% CO2. After attachment SPO at concentrations of 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg/mL (n\\u200a=\\u200a8/[SPO]in growth medium) was applied to the cells. Additionally, bovine catalase (100 U/mL), which accelerates the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen and acts as an antioxidant [28], was added to half of the wells at each [SPO]. After 2 hours of exposure to experimental treatments under normal incubation (20% O2 − 5% CO2, 37°C), a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed to assess metabolic function of the cells. In brief, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), MTT reagent was added to the wells for 4 hours (5 mg MTT/mL media), and the blue formazan precipitate was extracted from the mitochondria using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Absorbance of the solution was read using a spectrophotometer (Spectramax M5; 540 nm). Quantification of a viable cell population was expressed as the ratio of absorbance of the growth control (only cells).\\nThe capacity of SPO to maintain skeletal muscle contractility was further assessed under oxygenated conditions but with a fatiguing duty cycle (train duration/contraction interval; 0.2 s/2 s\\u200a=\\u200a0.1). Rat EDL muscle contractility can be preserved for ∼30 minutes in isolated preparations at physiological temperatures when the contractile duty cycle approximates zero [29], [33], [34]. However, as activity increases, and in suite the metabolic demand of the tissue, oxygen diffusion gradients in isolated muscle can be created, wherein even with 95% O2 perfused in the organ bath a hypoxic core within the muscle develops [33], [34], [35]. In this experiment, muscles underwent a similar pre-test, as described above, and then performed three bouts of 25 tetani (100 Hz, 200 ms train of 0.2 ms pulses, 2 s inter-train period, 0.1 duty cycle, 37°C) with 10 minutes rest between bouts. The active fatigue bout was estimated to result in a critical O2 diffusion radius of 0.2 mm [33], resulting in a 0.0674 cm3 hypoxic core within the EDL (considering the EDL as a cylinder with a 1 mm radius, a length of ∼3.3 cm, a mass of 130 mg, and a density of 1.06 g/cm3). To provide O2 to the entire hypoxic core (.0674 cm3×1.06 g/cm3\\u200a=\\u200a71.4 mg) assuming an oxygen consumption of 1.06 µL/s/g, as estimated from rat in vivo triceps surae contractile studies [20], a single bout required ∼ 3.78 µL of O2. Thus, with the delivery of ∼2.6 µL of O2 via SPO (1 mg/mL in 20 µL), we hypothesized a delay in the loss of contractility under these conditions. Tau (time to lose ∼63% of maximal active force) was calculated for each fatigue bout. To do so, contractions prior the peak measured force were removed (no significant differences between groups in the number of contractions to peak force was observed). Forces measured from the peak to the final tetani were fit with a single-decay exponential function:(5)\\nAdditional EDL muscle in vitro experiments were performed to compare SPO to an oxygen-carrying media designed for tissue salvage. Lifor® is a lipid-based oxygen carrier (LOC) for organ perfusion systems [6], [7], [8], [9], [36]. EDL muscles were injected with Lifor® and underwent contractile testing as described above for SPO-injected muscle.\\nStudy III: In vivo Analysis of SPO\\nIn vivo ischemia injury and SPO application\\nAfter observing that SPO injection partially preserved muscle contractility in Study Two, SPO was further tested in vivo in a rat model of partial hindlimb ischemia. Anesthetized rats were aseptically prepared for surgery by sterilizing the abdomen. A longitudinal incision was made along the abdomen. The thoracic aorta was uncovered, reaching the bifurcation to the left iliac artery. The artery, vein and nerve were isolated and the iliac artery and vein were separately ligated, using 5.0 silk suture, immediately distal to the thoracic bifurcation (i.e., proximal to any subsequent bifurcations). Animals recovered for 24 hours, at which time the TA muscle was treated with one of two treatment groups: 1) saline (vehicle) injections, and 2) SPO injections. Solutions were warmed to body temperature immediately before injection. In line with the boundary conditions for SPO treatment identified in Study Two, the TA muscle was injected with 40 µL of 2 mg/mL of SPO (4 injections of 10 µL each). Care was taken to position the injections directly into the TA muscle, with the four injections evenly spaced in four quadrants of the muscle. Assuming a resting rate of oxygen consumption of 0.06 µL/s/g [18], [19], this volume of O2 represents ∼22% of the O2 requirement of the TA muscle (425 mg for 30 minutes) while remaining within biocompatible limits defined in Study Two.\\nSodium percarbonate as received contains large particles making it incompatible for intramuscular injection (Figure 1A). Using cryogenic grinding and sifting, small homogenous particles were obtained, which exhibited diameters <25 µm (Figure 1A). These smaller particles readily dissolved and could be injected through a syringe needle. Absolute dissolved oxygen increased rapidly up to ∼10 mg/L at the highest studied concentration (10 mg/mL), which is slightly greater than the saturation of water but has been observed in hydrogen peroxide solutions [39]. After reaching a peak in the lower concentration (1 mg/mL), the oxygen concentration decreased over time, suggesting that the oxygen generation is short-lived (<3hours using this formation) and oxygen diffuses into the surrounding atmosphere (Figure 1B). Addition of SPO to physiological solutions caused an alkaline shift in the pH (Figure 1D), resulting from the carbonate ions released by SPO. pH returned to baseline values due to carbon dioxide gas exchange within the hypoxic incubators. Peroxide content of SPO samples was elevated within 3 hours of the reaction and peaked within 6 hours at approximately 10 µM, followed by a decrease towards baseline values within 24 hours (Figure 1C). These values were below toxic thresholds of peroxide observed in culture, which is approximately 10−3M [15]. At 24 hours, the hydrogen peroxide concentration was actually less for the 10 mg/mL than 1 mg/mL SPO group. Since hydrogen peroxide is less stable in more alkaline environments, the lower level of hydrogen peroxide detected is likely from the higher concentration of carbonate ions present which are able to create a more alkaline microenvironment. These findings suggest that hydrogen peroxide is a transient species instead of a stable byproduct of the reaction.\\nCharacterization of SPO chemical decomposition in an aqueous environment.\\n(A) SEM images of raw SPO particles before (left panel) and after (right panel) modifications to obtain small, uniform particles (<25 µm in diameter).

(D) pH kinetics of SPO (n\\u200a=\\u200a3). * Values are different from 0 mg/mL (blank) concentrations (p<0.001). Values are means ± sem.\\nTo identify a biocompatible range of SPO for skeletal muscle applications, C2C12 myoblasts were incubated for two hours with SPO concentrations of 0.001–10 mg/mL. The metabolically active population of cells decreased (Figure 2A; *p<0.0001) in a SPO concentration dependent manner, wherein at low concentrations (0.001–0.1 mg/mL) cell viability was reduced by ∼20–40%, while at higher concentrations (1 & 10 mg/mL) nearly 100% cell death occurred. This was likely due to hydrogen peroxide production, as addition of the antioxidant catalase (100 U/L) completely removed the cytotoxic effects of 1 but not 10 mg/mL of SPO (Figure 2A; *p<0.0001).\\nBiological and physiological compatibility of SPO.\\n(A) MTT viability assay of C2C12 myoblasts in the presence of increasing concentrations of SPO with and without the presence of bovine catalase (100 U/mL). Assays were performed after 2 hours of cell exposure to SPO and expressed as a ratio of growth controls (no SPO content). * Values are significantly different from 0.001 mg/mL within a given media (p<0.0001, n\\u200a=\\u200a8 per group). (B) Effect of saline (dashed line) and SPO (solid lines, all concentrations) on EDL muscle contractility in an oxygenated (95% O2–5% CO2) environment. * Values are different from saline group within the denoted frequency (p<0.05). Values are means ± sem; sample sizes are listed in Table 2.\\nThe effect of SPO on contractility of isolated whole EDL muscle was determined in an oxygenated (95% O2 – 5% CO2) environment (Figure 2B). The effect of the delivery method (i.e., injection via needle) on EDL force production is demonstrated in Figure S1A. Compared to saline injected control muscles, injection of 0.1 or 1.0 mg/mL SPO did not deleteriously affect force production. However, SPO concentrations of 5 and 10 mg/mL SPO reduced force at higher (100–200 Hz; *p<0.0001 compared to saline injected muscles) but not lower (1–60 Hz) stimulation frequencies (Figure 2B). Moreover, injection of the individual components of SPO (sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide) at concentrations found in 1 mg/mL SPO did not alter force production compared to saline injected or SPO injected muscles (Figure S1B). Collectively, these findings indicate that SPO at concentrations of 1 mg/mL or less are biocompatible, both in terms of cell viability and whole muscle contractility, when antioxidants are present.\\nNext, we tested the ability of SPO to maintain skeletal muscle contractility under hypoxic conditions (See Figure 3A for experimental design). In response to hypoxia (95% N2- 5% CO2), saline injected muscle contractility was diminished by ∼55±6, 65±3 and 38±4% at 60, 100, and 200 Hz, respectively. The greater force deficit at lower, than higher frequencies after hypoxia resulted in a downward, rightward shift in the abbreviated force-frequency curve (Figure 3B). Following the hypoxic protocol, return to oxygenated conditions (95% O2 – 5% CO2) in a subset of control muscles restored ∼15% of maximal tetanic force (Figure S2), similar to previously reported findings [40]. SPO injection of 1.0 mg/mL but not 0.1 mg/mL significantly improved the maintenance of oxygenated, pre-hypoxic force at all stimulation frequencies (Figure 3B; *p\\u200a=\\u200a0.083 at 60 Hz, *p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0314 at 100 Hz, *p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0005 at 200 Hz, compared to saline injected muscles) –1 mg/mL SPO injected muscles had a 38±4, 50±5, & 18±3% force deficit at 60, 100, and 200 Hz, respectively. SPO (1 mg/mL) appeared to improve the downward shift of the force-frequency curve, although a rightward shift was still evident (Figure 3C; #p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0189 at 60 Hz, #p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0001 at 100 Hz for saline injected muscles; #p\\u200a=\\u200a0.004 at 60 Hz, #p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0001 at 100 Hz for SPO injected muscles). The SPO mediated maintenance of contractility was likely due to the catalytic decomposition of SPO forming O2, as muscles injected with the individual components of SPO (i.e., 1 mg/mL equivalents of sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide) did not improve the maintenance of maximal tetanic force compared to saline injected muscle (Figure S3; *p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0048).\\nIn vitro contractility of resting EDL muscles under hypoxic conditions with and without SPO.\\n(A) Force tracings of a representative untreated muscle during the hypoxic protocol are depicted. (B) Per muscle, forces measured under oxygenated conditions and at the end of the hypoxic period (60, 100, and 200 Hz) were normalized to the maximal force (200 Hz) measured under oxygenated conditions. * SPO 1 mg/mL is greater than saline at each stimulation frequency. (C) Additionally, per muscle, these forces were normalized to the maximal force measured during each respective gas condition. # SPO 1 mg/mL and Saline are significantly reduced after ∼20 minutes of hypoxia (p<0.05). Values are mean ± sem; sample sizes are listed in Table 2.\\nHistological and biochemical metabolic indices of hypoxia further corroborated the contractile findings, that 1 mg/mL SPO decomposition generated a volume of oxygen capable of partially maintaining skeletal muscle homeostasis under hypoxic conditions. In response to hypoxia, SPO injection partially preserved intramuscular glycogen stores (*p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0103 compared to uninjured muscle), which were nearly completely depleted in untreated muscles (*p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0001 compared to uninjured muscle) (Figure 4 D–F, H; #p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0477 between untreated and SPO injected muscles), suggesting a greater use of oxidative metabolism in coordination with SPO decomposition [1], [41]. Additionally, 1 mg/mL SPO injection significantly attenuated the increased presence of nuclear co-localized HIF1α (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.1480 compared to uninjured muscle), which was observed in untreated muscles following hypoxia (*p\\u200a=\\u200a0.001 compared to untreated muscle) (Figure 4 A–C, G; #p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0007 between untreated and SPO injected muscles). And lastly, free radical oxidative stress or lipid peroxidation (MDA muscle content) observed in hypoxic untreated muscle (*p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0229 compared to uninjured muscle) was attenuated following 1 mg/mL SPO injection (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.1256 compared to uninjured muscle) (Figure 4I; #p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0253 between untreated and SPO injected muscles). Collectively, these findings indicate that 1 mg/mL SPO partially prevented a hypoxia-induced metabolic sequela, and correspondingly preserved a greater level of contractility.\\nHypoxia-induced HIF1α accumulation, glycogen depletion, and oxidative stress with and without SPO.\\nHistological assessment of EDL muscles with HIF1α (A, B, C) and PAS glycogen (D, E, F) staining for uninjured (native) (A,D), untreated (B,E) and SPO (1 mg/mL) (C,F). Quantitative analysis was performed with HIF1α (G) and intramuscular glycogen (PAS; H) stained sections. Lipid peroxidation was assessed by quantifying MDA concentrations (I). * p<0.05 compared to uninjured; # p<0.05 compared to untreated. Values are means ± sem; sample size\\u200a=\\u200a4–9/group.\\nWhole rat EDL muscles were also made to perform an active fatigue protocol in an oxygenated environment (95% O2–5% CO2) with or without SPO (1 mg/mL) injection. The premise of these experiments was that this level of activity at 37°C would induce the development of a hypoxic core (see methods;\\n[33], [34], [35]), which could conceivably be attenuated by SPO injection. In response to the contractile protocol, both saline- and SPO-injected muscles exhibited similar and significant active contractile fatigue profiles (Figures 5A & 5B, respectively). For example, during each successive fatigue bout, Tau was similar between experimental groups (Saline vs. SPO, n\\u200a=\\u200a3/group: Bout 1, 13.4±0.2 vs. 16.1±2.8 s, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.40; Bout 2, 11.9±0.4 vs. 14.4±2.5 s, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.38; Bout 3, 8.8±0.6 vs. 8.0±1.5 s, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.66). There were, however, significant differences between experimental groups in the rise in resting tension. While both groups had a similar resting tension during the first two fatigue bouts, throughout the third fatigue bout, resting tension was significantly greater for the saline than the SPO injected group (Figure 5C & 5D).\\nThe effects of SPO on EDL muscle in vitro contractility during activity under oxygenated conditions.\\nActive specific force (N/cm2) of saline injected (A) and SPO (1 mg/mL) injected (B) muscles was measured during three fatigue bouts of 25 tetanic contractions (100 Hz pulse frequency, 0.2 ms pulse width, 200 ms train) under oxygenated conditions (95% O2–5% CO2; 37 °C). Resting tension (N/cm2) of saline injected (C) muscles was significantly greater than SPO injected (D) muscle during the third fatigue bout (*p<0.05). Values are means ± sem; sample size\\u200a=\\u200a3/group.\\nTo demonstrate the utility of SPO-generated oxygen for the maintenance of muscle contractility under hypoxic conditions (95% N2–5% CO2), an oxygen-carrying technology designed for similar applications was tested for comparison. The lipid oxygen carrier (LOC) system (Lifor®) chosen has previously been shown to preserve renal tissue and cardiac muscle function following hypoxic conditions [6], [7], [8], [9], [36]. However, when injected into skeletal muscle the LOC system maintained maximal force (200 Hz) at a magnitude similar to saline injected control muscles (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.2037) and lesser than 1 mg/mL SPO (*p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0115) (Figure 6A–B, Table 2). A variety of experiments were conducted using the LOC as organ bath solution (as opposed to an injectable), which more closely approximates previously described methods of use for this LOC with other tissues [6], [7], [8], [9], [36], however, an improvement in the maintenance of force compared to saline injected muscle was not observed (data not shown). These findings lend further support that it is the generation of oxygen with SPO decomposition in a physiological environment that promotes the improved maintenance in contractility under hypoxic conditions.\\nComparison of an oxygen-generating (SPO) and an oxygen-carrying biomaterial for the preservation of EDL muscle homeostasis under hypoxic conditions in vitro.\\n(A) Active specific force (N/cm2) generated under oxygenated (dashed lines; 95% O2 – 5% CO2) conditions and then after ∼20 minutes (see experimental timeline in Fig. 3) under hypoxic conditions (solid lines; 95% N2–5% CO2) by EDL muscles injected with saline, SPO (1 mg/mL) and a lipid oxygen carrier (LOC). (B) Maintenance of oxygenated maximal isometric force (200 Hz) under hypoxic conditions was significantly greater for SPO 1.0 mg/mL than all other groups, * p<0.05. Values are means ± sem; sample sizes are listed in Table 2.\\nStudy III: In Vivo Evaluation of SPO in a Rat Hind Limb Ischemia Model\\nUpon finding that SPO generated oxygen was capable of partially maintaining skeletal muscle resting metabolism under hypoxic conditions in vitro (Study Two), we sought to determine the effectiveness of SPO for the preservation of ischemic skeletal muscle tissue in vivo. To promote ischemia in the rat hindlimb, the iliac artery was ligated for 24 hours, after which time the tibialis anterior muscle (the prime dorsiflexor) was treated and assessed for signs of tissue hypoxia. As a global metabolic index, TA muscle contractility was measured via neural stimulation of the common peroneal nerve in anesthetized rats (2.0–2.5%) for thirty minutes (contractions performed at 100 Hz, 200 ms, 5 minute resting interval) prior to harvesting muscles for glycogen content analysis. Over the 30-minute in vivo protocol, non-ligated control muscles did not demonstrate a reduction in torque and exhibited normal glycogen staining, indicating that with an intact blood supply, the contractile protocol does not induce fatigue (i.e., is not metabolically taxing) (Figure 7A). On the other hand, following iliac artery ligation, saline-injected TA muscles exhibited a ∼90% reduction in torque within 15 minutes, and out to 30 minutes, of contractile activity that corresponded with a nearly complete depletion of intramuscular glycogen (Figure 7A). These findings are consistent with others indicating increased susceptibility to muscular fatigue with hindlimb ischemia [38]. However, SPO injection maintained ∼30% of initial torque values out to 30 minutes of testing (Figure 7A; #p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0443) and maintained glycogen staining to a similar level as non-ligated muscle (Figure 7B, C–E; p\\u200a=\\u200a0.5687). These findings indicate that SPO-generated oxygen can, at least partially, maintain resting skeletal muscle metabolism in vivo in a model of partial ischemia.\\nIn vivo TA muscle contractility and glycogen depletion with and without SPO after 24 hours of hindlimb ischemia.\\n(A) Ratio of isometric torque (Nmm) measured during repeated tetanic contractions (100 Hz pulse frequency, 0.1 ms pulse width, 200 ms train duration, 1 contraction every 5 minutes) normalized to initial torque values.

This is the first report we are aware of that demonstrates that an oxygen-generating compound (SPO) ameliorates hypoxia-induced loss of skeletal muscle homeostasis and function both in vitro and in vivo. SPO was selected for this purpose because it theoretically produces sufficient amounts of oxygen to maintain skeletal muscle metabolism (Figure 1), via the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Herein we demonstrate, that a biologically and physiologically compatible concentration of SPO partially prevented: 1) the loss of contractility, HIF1α protein accumulation, glycogen depletion, and lipid peroxidation in vitro after a 30-minute incubation under hypoxic conditions (95% N2-5% CO2; 37°C) while muscles were relatively inactive (duty cycle <0.001); 2) the rise in baseline tension, indicative of a loss of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, in vitro during a contractile fatigue protocol (duty cycle\\u200a=\\u200a0.1) performed in oxygenated conditions (95% O2 – 5% CO2; 37°C); and 3) the diminution of TA muscle torque and glycogen depletion in a partial hindlimb ischemia model in vivo, again while the muscles were relatively inactive (duty cycle <0.001). Further, we demonstrate the utility of providing an oxygen-generating compound (SPO), as compared to an oxygen-carrying compound (see methods), for preservation of skeletal muscle contractility following an acute bout of hypoxia in vitro (95% N2-5% CO2; 30 min.; 37°C; duty cycle <0.001), in the absence of an intact vasculature. Collectively, the results of these studies support our overarching hypothesis that SPO, an oxygen-generating compound, has the capacity to support resting skeletal muscle metabolism under otherwise hypoxic conditions.\\nIn response to acute hypoxia, the loss of contractility in relatively inactive muscle results from an increased presence of free radicals and not the reduction of intramuscular high-energy phosphate content [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [40], [42]. In this way, diminution of contractility may serve as a protective mechanism, disallowing hypoxic muscle from using limited energy stores for increased activity [23]. Previous reports have demonstrated that the loss of muscle contractility in vitro is partially prevented by attenuating elevations of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species during hypoxia [22], [25], [40] or by the return to oxygenated conditions following hypoxia ([40]; Also demonstrated in Supporting Figure S2). While there are many potential sites and modes for redox modification of proteins to modulate skeletal muscle contractility (e.g., alterations in excitation-contraction coupling vs. myofilament cross-bridge formation) [43], the reduction of myofilament maximal Ca2+ activated force (Fmax) mediated by reactive oxygen species and potentially peroxynitrite has been identified as playing a significant role in hypoxia-related loss of contractility [40], [42]. In the current study, we observed that SPO (1 mg/mL) significantly attenuated the rise in oxidative stress observed in hypoxic saline injected muscles, indicating that SPO-mediated maintenance of contractility appears to be due to an attenuation of hypoxia-driven alterations of the cellular redox status. Further, the downward and rightward shift in the force-frequency curve that we observed after hypoxia in saline injected muscle is suggestive of potentially multiple sites of contractile disruption (e.g., EC-uncoupling and reduced maximal activated force). Of note, SPO injection appeared to improve only the downward, but not the rightward shift of the force-frequency curve – consistent with previous findings of ROS and RNS (peroxynitrite) reducing Fmax following hypoxia [40] or increased contractile activity under oxygenated conditions (95% O2) [44]. That the right-ward shift, indicative of EC-coupling disruption, was not affected by SPO treatment (Figure 3C) as compared to saline-injected muscles suggests that either a component of the EC-coupling machinery is more sensitive to hypoxia-driven perturbations to cellular homeostasis (e.g., [45], [46]) or that the injection itself is playing a role. Regardless, the findings of this study indicate that SPO conserves muscle contractility in hypoxic conditions by preventing related elevations in oxidative stress.\\nIt is well recognized that isolated whole rat muscle preparations have the potential to develop a hypoxic core during in vitro studies [35], even in supra-oxygenated conditions (95% O2) [33], [34]. As muscle temperature and/or activity increase, the estimated radius of O2 diffusion from the bath media decreases exponentially [33], and consequently, contractility is diminished. Additionally, contractility may be depressed by increased oxidative stress in superficial fibers exposed to supra-physiological levels of O2\\n[44], as well as ion (e.g., K+) diffusion related alterations in membrane polarization [47]. Herein, a fatiguing contractile protocol, using a preparation designed to exacerbate the development of hypoxia within the muscle (see methods), was implemented to test the capacity of SPO (1 mg/mL) to ameliorate contractile dysfunction related to the development of a hypoxic core. In this setting, SPO did not alter the loss of active force (Figure 5A & B). However, elevations of resting tension during the active fatigue protocol were attenuated by SPO injection (Figure 5 C & D). Previous reports on whole muscle or isolated fibers have demonstrated that a rise in baseline tension with hypoxia (or anoxia) and with increased activity is the result of elevated resting cytosolic Ca2+\\n[22], [48]. Specifically, the rise in resting tension in hypoxic diaphragm results from extracellular Ca2+ influx secondary to plasmalemma or T-tubule membrane damage, which may be attenuated by the removal of Ca2+ from the bathing media or by a superoxide scavenger [22]. Thus, the ability of SPO to attenuate elevations of lipid peroxidation in hypoxic muscle (Figure 4), may in part explain the improved maintenance of resting tension during the contractile fatigue protocol. Based on previous reports, it is expected that the observed maintenance of baseline tension by SPO would have a concomitant improvement in active forces [22], [49]. As a potential explanation for this unexpected observation, we posit that accumulation of extracellular K+ within the core of the depolarized muscle fibers irrespective of treatment [47], rendered these fibers insensitive to the electrical stimulus (0.2 ms pulse width) used in this study, but that they were still capable of contributing to resting tension. These findings demonstrate that 1 mg/mL SPO can effectively preserve components of resting homeostasis when the muscle is under oxidative stress imparted by metabolic activity.\\nFrom a clinical standpoint, the utilization of SPO technology to provide an adequate source of oxygen for cells and tissues would be of extreme value in cases where oxygen diffusion limitations exacerbate tissue damage and restrict the spectrum of therapeutic possibilities. Clinical evidence suggests the potential for oxygen to increase the efficiency of salvage of ischemic skin flaps/grafts [50] and crush injuries [51], [52] in humans in studies using hyperbaric oxygen treatment. This has also been an effective method to reduce skeletal muscle ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats [53], [54]. To investigate the capacity of SPO to preserve skeletal muscle homeostasis in vivo, an optimized SPO concentration and dosage were correlated from in vitro results and applied in a partial hindlimb ischemia rat model. This model has previously been shown to reduce blood flow to the lower extremities at rest and during activity and to diminish muscle function out to fourteen days after ligation [38]. In this scenario, SPO injection mitigated the impact of ischemia-induced muscle tissue hypoxia after 24 hours of iliac artery ligation, as reflected by an improved maintenance of anterior crural muscle contractility and glycogen preservation, compared to saline injected groups (Figure 7A). Interestingly, the amount of SPO injected into the TA muscle provided theoretically only ∼22% of the oxygen required for resting skeletal muscle of this size (see methods). However, even this amount of SPO- derived supplemental O2 appeared capable of partially preserving muscle homeostasis in this model. More comprehensive animal models and analyses should be performed to further optimize concentrations, volumes and perhaps improved formulations of, SPO.\\nThe primary advantage of an oxygen-generating versus oxygen-carrying material is the potential to deliver a sustained source of oxygen for the salvage of soft tissue following acute vascular trauma. The in vitro organ bath and in vivo studies performed herein validated the use of an oxygen-generating biomaterial, SPO, for the acute preservation of skeletal muscle viability in the absence of a functioning vasculature. Preceding the findings of the current study, SPO incorporated into scaffolds devoid of a vascular system has also been shown to improve cell survival and function of hypoxic 3T3 fibroblasts [55] and β cells and pancreatic islet cells [56]. In comparison, oxygen-carrying materials, such as PFCs, have improved skeletal muscle viability following ischemia, but these effects were observed with vascular delivery [57], [58]. To this end, the delivery of SPO for this indication (ischemic skeletal muscle secondary to vascular trauma/abalation) appears to be limited to intramuscular injection. While we demonstrate in the rat EDL muscle that bilateral needle injection results in acute reductions in contractility, it is not likely that this will present a significant limitation to translation to humans for the following reasons: 1) Intramuscular injection induces reparable damage to muscle fibers [59], which may result in an acute loss of contractility (as evidenced herein) but that would be far outweighed by the overall treatment outcome of greater soft tissue salvage; And, 2) intramuscular injection delivery in a matrix format that would allow for adequate diffusion of SPO through a large tissue bed is an accepted practice already utilized in clinical trials for other skeletal muscle therapies and indications [60], [61]. While the SPO injection protocol will clearly need to be further optimized in a large animal study, the present and preceding findings highlight oxygen generating materials as a potentially versatile system for providing required oxygen to cells and tissues under diverse conditions in which the vasculature is compromised or altogether absent.\\nThe primary goal of these studies was to determine if SPO could preserve skeletal muscle homeostasis in the rat EDL or TA muscles when oxygen delivery was compromised. The improved maintenance of TA and/or EDL muscle contractility when these muscles were placed under hypoxic or ischemic conditions appears to be directly related to the provision of supplemental oxygen via SPO. Several lines of indirect evidence support this supposition: First, injection of the individual components of SPO (i.e., H2O2 & H2CO3) did not improve (or exacerbate the loss of) contractility following an in vitro hypoxia protocol, indicating that it is the specificity for the production of O2 via the catalytic decomposition of SPO that is required for tissue preservation in these studies. Second, glycogen levels were partially spared following hypoxic or ischemia testing when SPO, but not saline, was injected, suggesting that SPO-derived O2 was capable of supporting oxidative metabolism to at least some extent [1], [41]. And lastly, SPO attenuated hypoxia-induced HIF1α accumulation within myonuclei in EDL muscle, which is recognized as the prime regulatory factor in skeletal muscle mediated, hypoxia-induced gene expression [62]. Therefore, we posit that SPO at 1 mg/mL is a biologically and physiologically compatible oxygen-generating biomaterial that, at the very least, can partially support resting metabolism and thereby prevent redox modifications that characterize the acute response to hypoxia and may lead to otherwise irreversible damage in skeletal muscle. However, one should keep in mind that skeletal muscle has a broad metabolic range, wherein metabolic activity may rise ∼6–10 times that of resting metabolism during intense activity [20]. In addition, human muscles are comprised of mixed fibers types with a continuum of metabolic and functional phenotypes that may present added challenges to SPO treatment [63]. It is currently unclear what the metabolic requirements are in vivo for tissue salvage following limb polytrauma, although there are reports indicating that skeletal muscle metabolism is elevated in response to injury [19] or trauma [64]. In short, based on our initial observations with this novel material, in the current test systems, it is reasonable to conclude that SPO-mediated oxygen delivery (even with this first generation biomaterial formulation) would be adequate for preservation of muscle homeostasis and function following traumatic injuries that are expected to largely eliminate voluntary movement of the damaged/affected limb. Future studies will be aimed at directly testing this hypothesis, by assessing the capacity of SPO to provide supplemental oxygen for the preservation of oxidative metabolism in the context of extremity trauma.\\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that utilizes oxygen-generating compounds to document mitigation of a hypoxia-induced loss of muscle homeostasis both in vitro and in vivo. Most current comparable therapeutic devices and technologies utilize materials with enhanced oxygen carrying capacity, but are largely dependent on an intact vascular network. The major advantage of SPO, in the context of limb polytrauma in which limb perfusion is compromised, is that it is a self-generating source of oxygen in aqueous environments. The studies presented herein are a promising foundation on which further development of this technology will continue in order to fill a translational research gap in the area of muscle tissue salvage and restoration.\\nPhysiological compatibility of the delivery of SPO and its components to isolated EDL muscle.

(B) Comparison of SPO components (as in the 1 mg/mL dose of SPO) to saline and SPO injections.

The aromatic\\ngroup would be transferred to the substrate as part of a stereocontrolled\\nreductive elimination process to form the enantioenriched TPO. At\\nthe outset of our studies, we were aware of a report by Zhao that\\nracemic arylation of SPOs can be achieved with diaryliodium salts\\nand simple Cu catalysts.8 By applying the\\nknowledge accrued from our enantioselective arylation studies with C2-symmetric bisoxazoline ligands, we began our\\nstudies with the straightforward merger of these sets of reaction\\nconditions toward the development of a catalytic enantioselective\\narylation process (Scheme 1d).\\nWe began by attempting the asymmetric arylation\\nof SPO 1a with substituted DAIS 2a using\\n(S,S)-diphenylbisoxazoline 4a as the chiral ligand,\\ncopper(II) triflate as the catalyst, and Et3N as the base\\nin CH2Cl2 solution at room temperature (Table 1). Unfortunately,\\nonly traces of 3a were observed under these conditions\\n(entry 1). However, we found that using the hindered base di-tert-butylpyridine (dtbpy) afforded the arylated TPO 3a with low conversion but importantly with modest enantiomeric\\nexcess (56% ee) (entry 3). A survey of readily available ligands showed\\nthat changing substituents on the oxazoline moieties or using the\\ncorresponding tridentate pyridinebisoxazoline (pybox) catalysts led\\nto no improvement using dtbpy as the base (entries 4 and 5). However,\\nwe were delighted to find that changing the solvent to MeCN while\\nretaining (S,S)-diphenylpybox 4d as the ligand and dtbpy as the base resulted in a dramatic\\nincrease in the ee of 3a, but only a modest yield. Moreover,\\nchanging the base to NaHCO3 resulted in a significant increase\\nin conversion, with 3a isolated in 99% yield (with respect\\nto DAIS 2a) and high ee. Further improvement was achieved\\nby changing the base to K2HPO4, and we found\\nthat the presence of 2 equiv of water was important in securing a\\nreproducible and robust reaction. Thus, the optimal conditions involved\\ntreatment of 2 equiv of SPO 1a with DAIS 2a as the limiting reagent in the presence of 10 mol % Cu(OTf)2, 12 mol % pybox ligand 4d, 2 equiv of K2HPO4, and 2 equiv of water in MeCN with stirring\\nfor 12 h at room temperature, which gave 3a in 96% yield\\nwith 96% ee after purification by silica gel chromatography.\\nWith an optimal process in hand, we next investigated\\nthe scope\\nof the SPO component in this transformation (Table 2). Simple SPOs bearing methyl and n-alkyl substituents were arylated to give the desired TPOs 3b–d with excellent ee and yield. SPOs\\nwith secondary branched alkyl groups also were excellent substrates\\nfor the arylation and gave high yields of 3e and 3f with excellent ee. Substrates with branching adjacent to\\nthe P atom gave mixed results. While arylation of t-Bu- and cyclohexyl-derived SPOs resulted in good yields of 3g and 3h, respectively, the enantioselectivities\\nwere moderate. However, cyclopropyl- and isopropyl-substituted SPOs\\nunderwent arylation in excellent yields to give 3i and 3j, respectively, with high ee using slightly modified conditions.\\nMore functionalized substituents, including benzyl and CH2SiMe3 groups, also gave the desired products (3k, 3l) in comparably high yields and ee.\\nEnantioselective Arylation of SPOs:\\nScope of the SPO Component\\nFinally, we sought to access P-stereogenic\\ncompounds bearing three\\ngroups of differing steric properties, namely alkyl, aryl, and ortho-substituted\\naryl. To achieve this goal, we reacted SPO 1b with ortho-substituted\\nDAISs. The reaction occurred smoothly with o-trifluoromethoxy\\niodonium salt to form the electron-deficient PAMP10 analogue 3ag in excellent yield with very\\ngood ee. An o-tolyl iodonium salt reacted in almost\\nquantitative yield to afford 3ah, again with excellent\\nee. We were also pleased to find that ortho-halogenated iodonium salts\\nreacted smoothly to produce TPOs with a convenient handle for further\\nfunctionalization (3ai–3ak) in high\\nyields and ee.\\nReflecting on a possible mechanism for this enantioselective\\narylation\\nprocess, our first impressions were that the reaction would operate\\nas an arylative kinetic resolution process. On the basis of the formation\\nof TPO 3a, its enantioselectivity, and the assumption\\nof first-order kinetics, this arylative kinetic resolution displays\\na selectivity factor of 148. Although in principle the starting material\\nshould be produced with enantiomeric excess, we found that isolating\\nthe remaining starting material was not trivial. A deleterious oxidation\\nprocess transforms the remaining SPO into the corresponding phosphinic\\nacid derivative, which undergoes O-arylation to give the phosphinate.\\nHowever, it was possible to isolate the small quantities of the remaining\\nSPO, and we were surprised that this material was either racemic or\\ndisplayed very low enantiomeric excess and hence was not consistent\\nwith a classical kinetic resolution. To probe this unusual finding,\\nwe conducted a series of control reactions. We tested the stability\\nof enantioenriched SPO (−)-1c under a number of\\nconditions related to the optimal process and were surprised to find\\nthat in all cases the remaining SPO was partially or fully racemized\\nin the presence of any of the reaction components (Scheme 2a) and accompanied by significant\\namount of the corresponding of aryl phosphinate. While this configurational\\ninstability of the SPO is contrary to most reports in the literature,\\nwe believe that racemization is the result of acid generated as a\\nresult of the deleterious oxidation pathway.\\nWe also showed that the reaction\\nof enantioenriched (−)-1c under standard conditions\\nbut without the chiral ligand\\ngave a stereospecific arylation in moderate yield accompanied by oxidative\\narylation to racemic phosphinate 5a (Scheme 2b). Reaction of (−)-1c with (S,S)-4d·Cu(OTf)2 leads to the productive, matched formation\\nof the arylation product in high er. However, we were surprised to\\nfind that the supposed mismatched experiment (with (R,R)-4d·Cu(OTf)2) gave\\na similar yield and high er of the opposite enantiomer of the product,\\naccompanied by the corresponding arylated phosphinate in low yield\\nand enantioselectivity (Scheme 2c). We rationalize this observation on the basis that the\\nstarting enantioenriched SPO must be racemizing during the reaction11 to form quantities of the enantiomer that is\\nmatched to the catalyst being used, resulting in arylation to give\\nthe observed TPO enantiomer. Taken together, these experiments hinted\\nat the opportunity for a dynamic kinetic resolution arylation of a\\nracemic SPO, but all attempts to secure such a transformation have\\nfailed; clearly, the mechanism of this enantioselective arylation\\nprocess is more complex than simply a kinetic resolution. Despite\\nthis, it is clear that the distinct Cu-catalyzed arylation process\\nprovides an effective way to produce enantioenriched TPOs in excellent\\nyield with very high enantiomeric excess.\\n', 'Considering the importance of both phosphorylation and expression in BCR-ABL pathogenecity, we design a BCR-ABL dephosphorylation-degradation system named SPOA which is consisted of SPO fusion peptide and antizyme1. SPO fusion peptide is generated by fusing GRB2 SH2 domain, PTP1B/C, and ODC. SPOA binds to BCR-ABL Y177 through SH2, dephosphorylates BCR-ABL Y177 by PTP1B/C, and directs BCR-ABL to protesome for degradation by ODC-AZ1. Thus, SPOA uncouples downstream signal cascades triggered by phosphorylation of BCR-ABL Y177. Also, SPOA directs BCR-ABL to proteasome for degradation, therefore attenuates BCR-ABL downstream signal activation. In this work, we investigated whether SPOA dephosphorylated BCR-ABL Y177 and degraded BCR-ABL protein in ubiquitin-independent manner, and whether SPOA depressed the oncogenecity of BCR-ABL in imatinib sensitive and resistant CML cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms. We also evaluated the effect of SPOA on leukemogenesis in mice.\\nGRB2 SH2 domain, PTP1B catalytic domain (PTP1B/C), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) were fused to generate the SPO fusion constructs with HA tag incorporated to the C-terminal. GRB2 SH2 R27 residue was substituted by lysine to generate a mutant, which failed to bind with BCR-ABL Y177 termed Sm [24]. PTP1B/C D181 residue was substituted by alanine to generate a mutant without catalytic activity termed PTP1B/Cm (Pm). Similar to SPO, SPmO, SmPO, and SmPmO were constructed by different combination of Sm, Pm, and ODC (Figure 1A). SPOA system consists of SPO fusion peptide and antizyme1 (AZ1). GRB2 SH2 domain directs PTP1B/C to BCR-ABL Y177 site and labels BCR-ABL with ODC (Figure 1B). To clarify whether SPOA system has dephosphorylation effect, we tested phosphorylated BCR-ABL Y177 (p-BCR-ABL Y177) in imatinib sensitive K562 and 32DP cell lines, and imatinib resistant K562R and 32DP T315I cell lines. As shown in Figure 1C, in contrast to imatinib inhibiting p-BCR-ABL Y177 only in imatinib sensitive cells, SPO dephosphorylated BCR-ABL Y177 in all cell lines, including the CML cells bearing T315I mutation. To survey the substrate specificity of SPO, we tested the phosphorylation of normal c-ABL kinase, a crucial regulator for cellular physiological function and the closest relative of BCR-ABL kinase, and found that it was not inhibited by SPO. These results demonstrate that SPOA system dephosphorylates BCR-ABL Y177 both in imatinib sensitive and resistant CML cells without decreasing c-ABL activation.\\nThe gene encoding SH2, PTP1B/C, ODC, or AZ1 was amplified through PCR from human cDNA. SH2 R27K (Sm) and PTP1B/C D181A (Pm) mutants were generated by overlapping PCR. SH2, PTP1B/C, and ODC were stepwise inserted into pAdTrack-CMV vector at the Kpn I, Sal I, Not I, and Xba I sites to develop a fusion gene termed SPO. SPmO, SmPO, and SmPmO were constructed similarly. AZ1 was inserted into pAdTrack-CMV vector at the Kpn I and Sal I sites. HA or FLAG tag was respectively added to the carboxyl terminal of ODC or AZ1. The expression cassette was used to generate recombinant adenovirus using the AdEasy system as previously described [42]. Cells were infected at an MOI of 105:1 for K562 and K562R cells or 3 × 105:1 for 32D, 32DP and 32DP T315I cells.\\n', \"A series of general and selective Pd(II)-catalyzed Heck reactions were investigated under mild reaction conditions. The first protocol has been developed employing an imidazole-based secondary phosphine oxide (SPO) ligated palladium complex (6) as a precatalyst. The catalytic coupling of aryl halides and olefins led to the formation of the corresponding coupled products in excellent yields. A variety of substrates, both electron-rich and electron-poor olefins, were converted smoothly to the targeted products in high yields. Compared with the existing approaches employing SPO–Pd complexes in a Heck reaction, the current strategy features mild reaction conditions and broad substrate scope. Furthermore, we described the coupling of arylboronic acids with olefins, which were catalyzed by Pd(OAc)2 and employed N-bromosuccinimide as an additive under ambient conditions. The resulted biaryls have been obtained in moderate to good yields.\\nIn the early 1970s, Mizoroki [10] and Heck [11] developed a palladium(0)-catalyzed cross-coupling of olefins with organic halides. Later, several other catalytic protocols were used with variations in their coupling procedures by changing metal sources, ligands, additives or substrates [12–16]. The class of phosphine-ligated palladium complexes [17–21] represents the most frequently employed precatalysts to achieve high reactivities and selectivities for such reactions. However, such trisubstituted phosphines in the palladium complexes are often air-sensitive in nature and easily oxidized [22–23]. Therefore, a new class of secondary phosphine oxide ligands (SPO) has been explored for these ligand-assisted palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions [24–27]. This type of SPO ligand is stable towards air and moisture and convenient to handle compared to the conventional trisubstituted phosphine ligands. Despite this advantage, the potential of these ligands has not been fully realized in Heck arylation reactions. Up to now, only a few examples of utilizing SPO-ligated palladium complexes in oxidative Heck reactions have been demonstrated [28–31]. Previously, we also reported the synthesis of cobalt-containing SPO ligands and their palladium complex. This was successfully applied as a catalytic precursor in oxidative Heck reactions [32]. However, these reactions were carried out at high temperatures with limited substrate scope. Therefore, the development of an alternative general and mild procedure employing a stable and inexpensive ligand is still in great demand.\\nIn this article we report two new protocols for Heck cross-coupling reactions: (i) a stable SPO ligated palladium complex 6 catalyzed cross-coupling of aryl halides 1 with olefins 2 at 60 °C; and (ii) Pd(OAc)2 catalyzed arylation of arylboronic acids 4 with olefins at 25 °C (Scheme 1).\\nIn the presence of solvents, secondary phosphine oxide (RR'P(O)H) might undergo tautomerization, which generates a less stable phosphinous acid (RR'POH) species. Subsequently, its coordination to the metal center through the phosphorus atom forms a phosphinous acid–metal complex [54–56]. Thus, the resulting transition-metal complex might function as an active catalyst in various C–C-bond-forming reactions. Ackermann et al. reported the synthesis of stable N-aryl-substituted pyrrole and indole-derived SPO-preligands, which were utilized in Kumada–Corriu cross-coupling reactions [57]. Recently, we reported the synthesis and characterization of imidazole-based secondary phosphine oxide ligand 5 and its application in C–C-bond-forming reactions (Scheme 2) [58]. Furthermore, the application of complex 6 in cross-coupling reactions has been carefully studied. We found that complex 6 is an active catalyst for the Heck reaction of aryl halides with olefins under mild conditions.\\nSynthesis of imidazole-based SPO–Pd complex 6.\\nIn summary, we have developed two new protocols for oxidative Heck reactions employing Pd(OAc)2 as a catalytic precursor. The first method is based on coupling between various olefins and aryl halides utilizing an imidazole-based secondary phosphine oxide ligated palladium complex (6) under mild conditions. The yields of products obtained were excellent and in high regioselectivity. Compared with the previously described procedures for the Heck reaction of aryl halides as substrates employing a SPO–Pd complex as a catalyst, the method reported here has the advantages of having a stable catalyst system, general substrate scope, and mild reaction conditions (60 °C). Secondly, we also developed the Heck reaction of arylboronic acids with various alkenes employing N-bromosuccinimide as an additive and catalyzed by Pd(OAc)2, under base- and ligand-free conditions at 25 °C. The yields of the coupled products are moderate to good.\\n\", \"Patients (New York Heart Association functional classification: NYHA1-3) with left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) < 60%, as determined by echocardiography were enrolled. They were referred for the following (1) acute myocardial infarction, (2) old myocardial infarction, (3) arrhythmia, (4) dilated cardiomyopathy. Patients were excluded if they had any of the following, (1) obstructive lung disease, (2) a history of stroke, (3) a clinical sign of central nerve system impairment. Patients with ischemic heart disease were treated with plain old balloon angioplasty and coronary stent placement. These subjects were examined with overnight (for 9\\xa0h) saturation monitoring transcutaneously, for mean oxygen saturation, number of desaturations, lowest arterial oxygen saturation (SPO 2 ), mean heart rate and max heart rate. An oxygen desaturation index (ODI), the number of desaturations per hour of sleep was computed. A desaturation was defined as a > 4% decrease in the saturation level. Subjects with oxygen desaturation of 4% (ODI4.0%) ≥ 4/h were examined with polysomnography (PSG). PSG monitoring was performed with the Morpheus (Teijin, Tokyo) for 9\\xa0h. Ventilatory flow at the nose was measured with thermistors. Ventilatory movements of the chest and abdomen were monitored. SPO 2  was measured transcutaneously with fingertip pulse oximetry. Apnea was defined as continuous cessation of airflow for more than 10\\xa0s, and hypopnea was defined as a reduction in airflow for more than 10\\xa0s with oxygen desaturation of ≥ 4%. Apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) was calculated as the total number of episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep. An AHI > 10 was considered diagnostic of sleep apnea syndrome (SAS). An AHI of ≥ 10 to < 20 indicated mild SAS, ≥ 20 to < 30 indicated moderate SAS, and ≥ 30 indicated severe SAS. We defined CSAS group as patients with central sleep apnea events > 50% of total AHI, OSAS group is defined those with obstructive sleep apnea events > 50% of total AHI. We evaluated all patients' urinary and plasma catecholamines concentrations, serum BNP and serum human atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP) levels, renin, aldosterone and cortisol when they were clinically stable (just before discharge the hospital) and no medication changes within the preceding 2\\xa0weeks. Urinary catecholamines were measured from 24-h urine. We measured serum eNOS levels just before we procedure cardiac catheter examinations. The CHF-CSA patients, whose AHI was over 20, were treated with nocturnal supplements of oxygen (9\\xa0h per day). Nasal oxygen was administered at 2\\xa0l/min and was raised progressively to 3\\xa0l/min if disordered breathing resulted in ODI4% > 4/h. No patient treated with nocturnal oxygen had been previously treated for sleep disordered breathing.\\n40 patients were treated with diuretics, 60 with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin-receptor antagonists, and 24 with Ca blockers, 29 with β-blockers. 28 patients had diabetes mellitus, 37 had hyperlipidemia, 48 had hypertension, and 41 patients were smokers. The three groups were similar in age, sex, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), classification of NYHA, medications (ACEI, angiotensin-receptor antagonists, diuretics, digoxin, Ca blocker and β-blocker), mean systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and complications (diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and smoking) ( Table 1 \\n                      ). There was no correlation between AHI and ejection fraction ( r \\n                      = 0.195,  P \\n                      = 0.3112). The ODI4% of the CHF-CSA and the CHF-OSA group were significantly higher than CHF-N group (CHF-CSA: 12.44 ± 10.42, CHF-OSA: 14.53 ± 14.68, CHF-N: 1.71 ± 1.54 events/h,  P \\n                      > 0.0001). The AHI were not different between the CHF-CSA group and the CHF-OSA group. The three groups were similar in mean heart rate, max heart rate, mean SPO 2 , hemoglobin, serum adrenaline, dopamine, renin, aldosterone, cortisol, BNP and hANP ( Table 2 \\n                      ). Lowest SPO 2  were significantly lower in the CHF-OSA than the CHF-N and the CHF-CSA group. Compared among the three groups, the CHF-CSA group had significantly higher 24-h urinary adrenaline (CHF-CSA: 4.411 ± 2.940\\xa0μmol/day, CHF-OSA: 2.686 ± 1.084\\xa0μmol/day, CHF-N: 3.178 ± 1.778\\xa0μmol/day,  P \\n                      < 0.05). There were no significant differences in 24-h urinary noradrenaline, dopamine and plasma catecholamine levels. And serum catecholamines and 24 urine catecholamines were similar in the CHF-OSA group and the CHF-N group. 18 CHF-CSA patients with AHI > 20 (11 patients had old myocardial infarction or dilated cardiomyopathy, and 7 patients had acute myocardial infarction) were treated with nocturnal supplements of oxygen, we measured ODI4%, AHI, LVEF, mean heart rate, max heart rate, mean SPO 2 , lowest SPO 2 , eNOS, serum BNP, hANP, renin, aldosterone, cortisol, plasma catecholamines levels, and 24-h urinary catecholamines before oxygen therapy, and at four months after starting nocturnal oxygen ( Table 3 \\n                      ). Oxygen therapy significantly decreased ODI4.0% (from 12.31 ± 10.24 events per hour to 1.19 ± 1.12 events per hour, 12  P \\n                      = 0.0005), AHI (from 33.1 ± 11.3 events per hour to 6.23 ± 3.16 events per hour, mean change = 25.387 events per hour,  P \\n                      = 0.0004) and serum BNP (from 91.75 ± 80.35\\xa0pg/ml to 52.75 ± 45.70\\xa0pg/ml, mean change = 33.85\\xa0pg/ml,  P \\n                      = 0.0208) levels. LVEF, plasma and urinary catecholamine levels did not change significantly ( Table 3 ). Serum BNP of CHF-N patients did not change significantly (from 109.79 ± 143.41 pg/ml to 118.75 ± 187.49\\xa0pg/ml  P \\n                      = 0.2971). There were no significant difference in 24-h urinary catecholamines between patients treated with β-blocker and patients without β-blocker. Serum eNOS levels were lower in the CHF-CSA group and the CHF-OSA group than in the CHF-N group (CHF-CSA: 15.89 ± 10.75\\xa0pg/ml, CHF-OSA: 7.46 ± 3.91\\xa0pg/ml, CHF-N: 27.33 ± 14.83\\xa0pg/ml,  P \\n                      < 0.05). There were no difference in eNOS between ischemic heart disease and the other disease. Nocturnal supplement of oxygen did not reduce serum levels of eNOS.\\nThe aim of this study is to examine whether nocturnal supplemental oxygen reduces SNA, and prevents progress of CHF. Actually 24-h urinary adrenaline was significantly higher in the CHF-CSA than the CHF-N group, and nocturnal supplemental oxygen reduced serum BNP levels, but did not reduce urinary catecholamines. CSA occurs in approximately one third of patients with CHF  [21,22]  and may be associated with increased mortality compared with CHF patients without apnea  [23,24] . SNA are elevated in CHF-CSA and CHF-OSA compared with CHF-N and are related to CHF  [10] . Peter et al. showed that overnight urinary catecholamines can be an integrated markers of SNA, and overnight catecholamines were significantly higher in CHF-CSA than in CHF-OSA and CHF-N  [25] . Other study demonstrated a significantly elevated awake cardiac and total body norepinephrine spillover in patients with CHF-CSA compared with CHF-N and CHF-OSA  [10] . In this study 24-h urinary catecholamines were used as markers of SNA. The 24-h urinary adrenaline in the CHF-CSA group was higher than those of the CHF-OSA group and the CHF-N group, but serum catecholamines levels were not significantly different among the three groups. Urinary catecholamines levels may serve as more representative indicator of overall nocturnal sympathetic activity than spot serum sampling in the morning  [20] . Treatment for sleep apnea include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and supplemental oxygen. CPAP is the most widespread treatment, but because of relatively poor patients acceptance in some studies  [26] . We selected nocturnal oxygen therapy for the CHF-CSA patients. The treatment with nocturnal oxygen significantly decreased ODI4.0%, AHI, Serum BNP levels, increased mean SPO 2  and lowest SPO 2  at four months after oxygen therapy. But plasma catecholamines levels and 24-h urinary catecholamine levels did not change significantly at four months. The half-times of catecholamines are very short, the values changes easily react to the mental and physical situation of patients. It was difficult to equalize the situation of blood sampling. The early study of Harrison and colleagues  [27]  showed that at least in some patients, Cheyne–Stokes respiration decreased as pulmonary edema and heart failure improved. Margot et al. showed that SDB occurs commonly in patients presenting with an acute cardiovascular event, and when investigated in the short term, sleep-related breathing abnormalities are often transient, so sleep studies to investigate SDB should be carried out when the patient is clinically stable  [28] . BaHammam et al. reported that the AHI was lower at the point of 6\\xa0months after acute coronary event, than 3\\xa0days after acute coronary event  [29] . So every laboratory data and sleep study were examined when the patients were clinically stable; no change of medication was made during the period. In the case of acute coronary syndrome, we measured all data and study over 2\\xa0weeks after the acute coronary event, just before they left hospital. Javaheri et al. reported that low LVEF was associated with increased prevalence of CSAS  [30] . But there have been no reports proving that the LVEF (%) is related the AHI. All data reported was that mean LVEF was similar in CHF patients with CSAS and without CSAS. In our study there was no correlation between AHI and ejection fraction ( r \\n                      = 0.195,  P \\n                      = 0.3112).\\n\", 'Simulated SPO\\n2 \\nvalues associated with FIO\\n2 \\nand PaCO\\n2\\n/arterial pH\\n', \"The physical rearrangement of the surface, as presented above, is a versatile and easy way to control its wetting properties. On the other hand, the wetting properties of a surface can also be controlled depending upon its chemical restructuring. In short, water being a polar molecule should show stronger adhesion to a polar surface. PVDF can be either polar or non-polar depending upon the conformation of its chains and its crystallinity3839. Its crystalline β-phase, which has all the fluorine atoms on one side of the chain, is highly polar40. On the other hand, the surface of amorphous PVDF would be less polar because the chains are laid in a random fashion and cancel the effect of each other. So an amorphous structure is expected to pose a less binding surface towards a water drop and its sliding on such a surface is supposedly easier. In contrast to wide wisdom, we believe that even in a highly crystalline polymer, foreign polar molecules can weaken and replace the polymer–polymer interactions with polymer–molecule interactions and hence decrease its crystallinity41. Indeed SPO can be switched between “opened, highly polar” and “closed, less polar” form not only on exposure to UV and white light respectively but its open form is also stable in its solvents42. Accordingly, 10\\u2005wt.% spirooxazine (SPO) was blended with the polymer solution in Dimethylformamide (DMF) that acted not only as a common solvent for polymer and SPO but also caused the SPO molecules to convert into their “open, highly polar” form by creating a polar environment around them. This was evident by the dark blue color of PVDF-10\\u2005wt.% SPO solution, Figure 3a. DMF evaporated during electrospinning but in the mean time part of SPO open form was stabilized by a dipole-dipole interaction with the polymer, Figure 3b. That is why; the fibers had a grayish blue color right after electrospinning, Figure 3c. After blending SPO with the polymer, it was expected that the molecules of the photochromic compound could disturb the regular chain arrangement required for a crystalline structure since they acted as side branches and hindered the alignment of chains required for crystallinity, Figure 3b43. This could result in fibers being dominantly amorphous with consequent effects on the sliding angle of drop. Indeed, change in crystallinity after adding SPO was seen in the wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) analysis. For the neat PVDF fibers, a strong peak was observed, which suggested that they were dominantly crystalline in either β-phase or its resembling γ-phase, Figure 3d. These two phases are difficult to distinguish from each other by X-ray diffraction, but share a common property that both are polar and thus can ensure good stability of open form of SPO, which is also polar41. With the addition of SPO, the strong peak representing crystalline phase was eliminated. As discussed above, the amorphous PVDF being less polar, should offer a surface to the droplet that is only weakly sticky. Thus, the drop could slide on it at a lower tilt angle compared to that in the case of neat crystalline PVDF yarn, Table 2.\\nHowever, since a part of SPO embedded in the PVDF fibers was already in the open form, exposure to UV did not bring about such a big change in sliding angle which could be taken as a trend. This was supported by static contact angle measurement, which showed a very small effect, i.e., a change from 135° before UV to 131° after UV exposure.\\nHere it is worth mentioning that only slippy state of a hydrophobic surface is not important but also the sticky state has its own applications. We demonstrate here, the ability of random fibers mat to arrest a drop as a novel way to create two-dimensional patterns by using water drops as tiny ball lenses, Figure 4a. The drops were deposited on a mat of PVDF fibers containing 10\\u2005wt.% SPO, to write the word “LENS”. Upon orthogonal UV exposure, water droplets that acted as lenses, deviated the light, concentrating it on the point where the drop was in contact with the fiber mat, thus creating a kind of “UV hotspot”, Figure 4b. Each individual spot consisted of an inner dark blue area, (‘Region A', Figure 4b) because of exposure to highly concentrated UV dose. As the water lens concentrated the light in the centre, the area surrounding the darker region, directly under the curve of the water lens, did not receive any UV exposure and remained in the faint grayish blue color of original fibers (‘Region B', Figure 4b). The rest of the area (‘Region C', Figure 4b) also had a blue color but it was lighter than the ‘Region A' because here, UV was not concentrated. The image formed by selective UV exposure was erasable by intense white light, after which the surface was ready for the next patterning, Figure 4a. On the other hand, a similar pattern could also be made on PVDF film containing 10\\u2005wt.% SPO but since the film was not superhydrophobic, therefore the contact area of water drop with the film surface was bigger compared to that in the case of fibers, Figure 4c. Here, the darker area in the middle of impression made by the drop after UV exposure was about four times bigger more than that observed in the case of fibers. This meant that the light concentration effect and the minimum feature size producible on the film were far less than that on the fibers. The advantage of using water is the availability, ease of application and removal and no damage to the delicate substrate, which may be a concern if using other type of lenses.\\nPolymer solution for electrospinning was prepared by dissolving 11\\u2005wt.% of Polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) in N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF). For fibers loaded with 1,3-Dihydro-1,3,3-trimethylspiro[2H-indole-2,3′-[3H]phenanthr[9,10-b](1,4)oxazine] (i.e., SPO), 10\\u2005wt.% of it was added to the polymer solution. Electrospinning was done by pushing the polymer solution through a needle that was connected to a high voltage source of 8\\u2005kV. Because of electrohydrodynamic nature of the process, the polymer stretched into the form of fibers, which were collected at the base plate in the form of a mat. This mat was simply lifted from the target, spread over a glass plate, and subsequently tested for its wetting properties. Yarns were made by manually rolling and stretching a thin layer of mat collected on the target plate. These yarns were then laid over the glass plate, which was already covered with a layer of random fiber mat. The polymer film was made by blade casting method, from the same solution of PVDF that used for electrospinning of fibers.\\nContact angle and sliding angles were measured on OCA15 machine from ‘Dataphysics' using 14\\u2005μL water drops. To study the UV effects on contact angle and sliding angle, a UV lamp (Labino AB, 35\\u2005W) with its peaks intensity in the range of 365\\u2005nm was used. The writing with “water lenses” was carried out by manually delivering of 2\\u2005μL water drops on the random fiber mat surface in the form of a pattern. After the first writing, the surface was recovered by exposing it to white LED light source. For analyzing the effect of UV absorbents, suspended in the water, drops of colloidal silver and gold solution containing nanoparticles of size range 5–10\\u2005nm were placed over PVDF nanofibers containing 10\\u2005wt.% SPO. These were then exposed to a white light (Labino AB, 35\\u2005W) for one minute.\\n\", 'DRUGand    ALCOHOL^    DEPENDENCE    ELSEVIER    Drug and Alcohol\\nDependence 38 (1995) 19-24    Effects of chronic alcohol intake on the\\nvasopressin content in  the hypothalamic paraventricular and\\nsupraoptic nuclei of the  mouse.

Introduction    The hormone vasopressin is\\nprimarily synthesized in  the hypothalamus and transported and stored\\nin the  neurohypophysis in order to be released into blood\\ncirculation following physiological and chemical stimuli  (Schrier and\\nLeaf, 1981; Harding et al., 1992). The  supraoptic (SPO) and\\nparaventricular (PVN) nuclei of  the hypothalamus are the main sources\\nfor vasopressin  (VP), although VP is also found in other hypothalamic\\nand extrahypothalamic structures (Buijs, 1978; Caff and Van Leeuwen,\\n1983; Lind et al1985; Gulya et al.,  1991).    The synthesis and/or\\nrelease of VP can be altered by  ethanol intake, as it has been\\nreported that ethanol  treatment for 7 days results in a decrease of\\nvasopressin  mRNA levels in the hypothalamus, thereafter reducing    *\\nCorresponding author.    the synthesis of VP (Ishizawa et al., 1990;\\nGulya et al.,  1991). Since ethanol acutely inhibits VP release from\\nthe  posterior pituitary (Beard and Sargent, 1986), it has  been\\nsuggested that chronic exposure to this inhibitory  effect could lead\\nto an adaptative \\'down regulation\\' of  VP mRNA (Rehbein et al., 1986).\\nAssociation between salt-water balance, hypertension  and alcohol\\nconsumption has often been described  (Beevers, 1977) and several\\nlines of evidence support the  role of the PVN in the integration of\\nneuronal signals in-  volved in blood pressure control, drinking and\\narginine-  vasopressin release (Sawchenko and Swanson, 1983;\\nHarding et al., 1992).

This diet\\nis nutritionally equilibrated and cannot have in-  fluenced the\\nfindings. The animals were sacrificed at the  postnatal 35th, 180th\\nand 365th day, each of these age-  subgroups consisting of 5 animals.\\nThe first group was  a control group, while the second experimental\\ngroup  received ethyl alcohol added to the drinking water (ad\\nlibitum) at a concentration of 20%, from birth till the day  of\\nsacrifice.

The global\\nvolume of the SPO (F = 5.617) is higher in  the experimental animals\\nthan in the control animals at  the 180th and 365th days (P < 0.01 and\\nP < 0.05, respec-  tively). Global volume increases with age in both\\ngroups  of animals, but while in the control group this increase  is\\ndetected in animals of 365 days (P < 0.05), in the exper-  imental\\ngroup the volume of the SPO is already bigger  in animals of 180 days\\n(P < 0.01) compared to younger  mice (Fig. 2F).    Thus, during\\nchronic alcohol intake, the intensity of  the A-V reaction in the PVN\\nand SPO is greater in the  experimental than in the control group at\\nthe 35th and  180th days, but not at the 365th day, the age at which\\nthe intensity of the reactions is similar in both groups.  In the PVN\\nthis increase in the intensity of the reaction  in the experimental\\ngroup is not accompanied by a parallel  increase in the nuclear area\\nsizes and/or global volume  of the nucleus.

This transport from the SPO and PVN  to the NHY seems\\nto be modulated by angiotensin II  (AGII) through a connection from\\nthe anteroventral  region of the third ventricle and subfomical organ\\n(SFO)  to the SPO and PVN (Lind et al., 1985; Tanaka, 1989;    Bains\\net al., 1992).    Although many authors postulate that a more intense\\nimmunohistochemical reaction does not necessarily in-  dicate a higher\\ncontent of the antibody, in our experiment    we think that this\\nrelationship could be possible as several  previously established\\nconditions occur in this experiment:    (a) animals were fed,\\nsacrificed, fixed and embedded in  paraffin in exactly the same\\nconditions and (b), more  importantly, all the slides were processed\\nfor inununo-  histochemistry at the same hour and day and using ex-\\nactly the same solutions of the antibodies. On this basis,  we think\\nthat a more intense reaction to A-V suggests a  higher content\\nofvasopressin in the nucleus. The content    E. Carmona-Catero et al.\\n/ Drug and Alcohol Dependence 38 (1995) 19-24    23    ofvasopressin\\nincreases with age in the control group in  both PVN and SPO nuclei,\\nprincipally in the oldest, 365-  day animals. However, in the\\nalcoholic mice, this age-  dependent increase of the reaction is not\\nso striking. It  seems that alcohol treatment in some way influences\\nthe  normal increase with age of this peptide content of  hypothalamic\\nPVN and SPO nuclei. The more intense  reaction to A-V by the alcohol-\\ntreated animals at the 35th  and 180th days, suggests a higher content\\nofvasopressin  in the SPO and PVN. At the 365th day this difference\\ndisappears, and this fact could be related to the above  mentioned\\nincrease ofvasopressin content with age in the  control group and/or\\nto an increase ofvasopressin release  in the oldest alcoholic animals.\\nThe increase in vasopressin content in the studied  hypothalamic\\nnuclei could be due to an increase of  production or a decrease in the\\nrelease. Although the pre-  sent experiment and the morphometric\\nstudies cannot  clearly define which of these alternatives is more\\nimpor-  tant regarding the results, we may suggest an explana-  tion\\non the basis that the nuclear sizes represent an index  of the nuclear\\nfunction. Alcohol intake in mice, at least  during the first 180 days\\nof treatment, would produce an  inhibition of vasopressin release\\nand/or transport from  the SPO and PVN to the NHY and this inhibition\\ncould  in some way be related to an effect ofethanol on the cen-  tral\\nangiotensin II, which controls the regulation of this  release. In the\\nPVN the increase of vasopressin content  is neither accompanied by an\\nincrease in the nuclear area  sizes, which are known to be related to\\nthe functionality  of the nucleus (Edstrom and Eichner, 1960; Pez-\\nDelgado, 1984), nor with an increase of the PVN global  volume.\\nHowever, we have found that in the SPO these  morphometric parameters\\ndo increase significantly at the  180th and 365th days. So, in the SPO\\nthe increase of the  vasopressin content may presumably be due to both\\nfac-  tors, the inhibition of the release and an increase in the\\nproduction of the hormone. These results disagree with  the down\\nregulation ofVP mRNA suggested by Rehbein  et al., 1986, after chronic\\nexposure to ethanol and cor-  roborated later by other authors\\n(Ishisawa et al., 1990;    Gulya et al., 1991). It seems then that the\\nincrease of func-  tionality (increase of nuclear area sizes) that we\\ndetect here  only in the SPO is not enough to be shown in the global\\nVP mRNA hypothalamic levels, suggesting a parallel  decrease of\\nfunctionality in other hypothalamic sources  ofvasopressin.\\nConsidering that the SPO nuclear area is  slightly bigger in the\\nalcohol-treated animals at 365 days  (P < 0.05) (suggesting a higher\\nproduction ofvasopressin  compared to the control animals), while the\\nintensity of  A-V reaction is similar, we will suggest at this age an\\nincrease ofVP release or transport compared to the con-  trol group.\\nSeveral authors have reported a relationship between  voluntary\\nalcohol intake and central angiotensin II  (AGII) (Grupp et al., 1988;\\nHubbell et al., 1991; Grupp  and Chow, 1992); it would be the SFO\\nwhich mediates    the effect of systemically administered AGII on\\nalcohol  intake (Grupp et al., 1989). The SFO seems to play an\\nimportant role in the control ofvasopressin release from  the\\nposterior pituitary in response to AGII (Knepel et al.,  1982; lovino\\nand Steardo, 1984; Tanaka et al., 1987).  However, observations based\\non electrical and chemical  stimulation of the SFO, indicate that SFO\\nefferents have  both excitatory and inhibitory influences on the VP-\\nsecreting cells of the PVN (Tanaka et al., 1985, 1986;    Tanaka,\\n1989). It seems that excitatory effects would be  mediated through a\\nconnection of the SFO with the me-  dian preoptic nucleus of the\\nhypothalamus, while a  pathway through the region of the septum would\\nhave  inhibitory effects on PVN neurohypophyseal neurons. We  have\\npreviously reported alterations in the global volume  of the SFO after\\nchronic alcohol treatment and suggested  that the increase in its\\nvolume could be related to varia-  tions in salt-water balance and/or\\nblood pressure that  occur in chronic alcoholism (Castaneyra-Perdomo\\net al.,  1991). Although alcohol has been reported to enhance the\\nformation ofANGII in plasma (Ibsen et al., 1985; Wright  et al.,\\n1986), and Gulya et al. (1991) have communicated  that chronic ethanol\\ntreatment produces an increase in  plasma osmolality in mice, but not\\nan increase in plasma  levels of vasopressin after 7 days of ethanol\\ntreatment,  suggesting that dehydration occurs as a side effect of\\nchronic ethanol treatment, we did not detect any effect  on the amount\\nof drinking after ethanol treatment.    As all these data confirm the\\nimportance of angioten-  sin and SFO in the release of vasopressin by\\nthe hypo-  thalamus and suggest close relationships between ethanol,\\nVP, ANGII and SFO, we hypothesize here that our pre-  sent results\\nconcerning vasopressin content in the PVN  and SPO after chronic\\nethanol treatment could be related  to a possible inhibition in the VP\\nrelease due to an effect  of alcohol on the hypothalamic\\nangiotensinergic inner-  vation from the SFO, as we reported\\npreviously that this  CVO is also affected by alcohol treatment\\n(Castaneyra-  Perdomo et al., 1991). Considering that SFO efferents\\nhave shown both excitatory and inhibitory effects on the  PVN (Tanaka\\net al., 1985, 1986; Tanaka, 1989), and  chronic alcoholism seems to\\nincrease ANGII levels (Ibsen  et al., 1985, Wright et al., 1986), the\\ninhibitory effect on  VP release that we describe here could be\\nrelated to this  increase of ANGII levels. To prove this hypothesis,\\nfur-  ther experiments conducted to vary physiologically and/or\\nchemically the levels of systemic and central angiotensin  are being\\ndesigned, to see if manipulations in the levels  of this peptide\\nreverse the effects of chronic ethanol treat-  ment on the release\\nand/or synthesis of vasopressin by  the PVN and SPO.\\nAcknowledgement    This study was supported by the Consejeria de\\nEduca-  cion del Gobierno Autonomo de Canarias Projects Nos.\\n40/08.03.90 and 91/244.    24    E.

(B) Wild-type (FW1511) cells or cells harbouring the tpk1M164G, tpk2Δ, tpk3Δ alleles (tpk1-as, FW1762) were grown in YPD overnight, diluted to 0.2 (OD600), and subsequently cells were treated with 5μM 1NM-PP1or untreated. Cell density (OD600) was measured over time at the indicated time points. (C) IME1 promoter activity was measured in a diploid tpk1-as strains and the IME1 promoter fused to LacZ reporter (FW1976). Cells were grown in YPD overnight, diluted into YPD or shifted to sporulation medium (SPO), and samples were taken after 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours. β-galactosidase activity was measured using a quantitative liquid ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) assay (see Materials and Methods for details). The promoter activities are displayed in Miller Units, and the standard error of the mean of at least two biological experiments is shown. (D) Similar to C except that cells were shifted to SPO, SPO plus 2% glucose or SPO with 2% glucose and 5μM 1NM-PP1. Samples were taken at the indicated time points. (E) Similar to C, except that samples shifted to YPD or YP-acetate (YPA), YPA plus rapamycin or YPA plus 1NM-PP1. (F) Similar to C except that cells were shifted to SPO or YPD and treated with rapamycin, 1NM-PP1 or both compounds. (G) IME1 mRNA quantification of cells shifted from YPD to SPO or YPD plus rapamycin, 1NM-PP1, or both compounds. Samples were taken at the indicated time points. Total RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, and IME1 mRNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR. Signals were normalized to ACT1 levels. The standard error of the mean of at least two biological experiments is shown.\\nTo measure IME1 promoter activity in response to modulating PKA activity, we used an IME1-promoter LacZ reporter fusion (pIME1-LacZ) that was integrated at the IME1 locus without disrupting the endogenous IME1. This fusion serves as an accurate readout for IME1 promoter activity [7]. When we shifted control and tpk1-as diploid cells from rich medium containing glucose (YPD) to sporulation medium (SPO), a condition which induces IME1, β-galactosidase activity increased (S1B Fig and Fig 1C). The β-galactosidase levels were comparable between the two strains suggesting that tpk1-as allele does affect IME1 regulation in SPO (S1B Fig). As expected, IME1 promoter activity did not increase when tpk1-as cells were shifted to fresh YPD (Fig 1C).\\nUsing the tpk1-as and pIME1-LacZ system, we first determined whether glucose repression of IME1 is mediated by PKA signalling. Cells were shifted from YPD to SPO, or to SPO medium containing glucose in the presence or absence of the ATP analog 1NM-PP1 (Fig 1D). IME1 promoter activity was strongly reduced in the presence of glucose. In contrast, when PKA was inhibited IME1 promoter activity was comparable with cells grown in the absence of glucose. This result shows that glucose inhibits IME1 expression predominantly via the PKA signalling pathway.\\nTo examine whether PKA and TORC1 are the major mediators of nutrient control of IME1 expression, we inhibited either or both pathways in cells grown in rich medium containing glucose (YPD) (Fig 1F and S1C Fig). Inhibition of TORC1 had no effect on IME1 expression. In contrast, IME1 promoter activity strongly increased between 8 to 12 hours following treatment with PKA inhibitors. Interestingly, when both PKA and TORC1 were inhibited, IME1 induction was already noticeable at 4 hours, and peaked at 8 hours and was remarkably similar to levels seen in cells incubated in SPO medium (Fig 1F and S1 Fig). Similar results were obtained when IME1 mRNA levels were examined (Fig 1G). These data show that the combined inhibition of PKA and TORC1 activities is sufficient to mimic nutrient control of IME1 expression. We conclude that TORC1 and PKA are two major mediators of nutrient regulation of IME1 expression.\\nOur results show that inhibition of PKA leads to some degree of IME1 expression in rich medium (YPD) (approximately 50% of that observed in SPO medium; Fig 1F and 1G). One explanation for this observation is that PKA inhibition induces IME1 at low or intermediate levels in all cells. It is also possible that IME1 induction occurs only in a subpopulation of cells when PKA is inhibited. To distinguish between these possibilities, we measured the distribution of IME1 expression in cells by single molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) (Fig 2A). The technique can reliably measure absolute transcript levels in single cells [17]. To ensure that the signals were specific and probes entered the cells, we first measured IME1 and ACT1 transcript levels in wild-type and ime1Δ diploid cells that were induced in SPO medium (S2 Fig). While IME1 was expressed in the wild type, no transcripts were detected in ime1Δ cells. As expected, ACT1 levels were comparable between the two strains (S2B Fig). Next, we counted the mean number of IME1 transcripts in cells grown in rich medium shifted to SPO medium, or treated with PKA or PKA/TORC1 inhibitors (Figs 2A and 1B). The IME1 expression pattern matched the RT-PCR experiment (compare Figs 1G and 2B). In cells treated with the PKA inhibitor IME1 levels increased after 8 hours to about 10 copies per cell on average. When both TORC1 and PKA were inhibited, IME1 was transcribed efficiently and cells contained on average 30 copies per cell at 8 hours after treatment, which was comparable to IME1 levels in SPO medium (Fig 2B).\\n(A) Representative images used for the analyses of IME1 and ACT1 transcript levels in single cells. Cells harbouring tpk1-as (FW1762) were grown in YPD overnight and were either shifted to SPO, or diluted into fresh YPD plus rapamycin, 1NM-PP1 or 1NM-PP1/rapamycin. Cells were fixed, hybridized with probes directed against IME1 (AF594) and ACT1 (Cy5), and were imaged (see Materials and Methods for details). ACT1 was used as an internal control and only ACT1 positive cells were selected for the analysis. (B) Mean of IME1 and ACT1 transcripts’ number among single cells as described in A. Cells harbouring tpk1-as (FW1762) were grown in YPD overnight, diluted into fresh YPD plus 1NM-PP1 or 1NM-PP1/ rapamycin and samples were taken at the indicated time points. Cells were imaged and quantified (see Materials and Methods for details). At least, 60 cells (n = 60) were quantified per time point. The standard error of the mean of at least two biological experiments is shown. (C) Distribution of IME1 and ACT1 transcripts among single cells grown in YPD as described in A and B. Cells were binned in five classes of transcript levels (0 to 5; 6 to 10; 11 to 15; 16 to 20 and 21 or more transcripts per cell) and the percentages of each class contributing to the total population are indicated. At least, 60 cells (n = 60) were quantified per time point. The standard error of the mean of at least two biological experiments is shown. (D-G) Similar to C except that cells were grown in YPD overnight and transferred to YPD plus rapamycin (D), YPD plus 1NM-PP1 (E), YPD plus 1NMPP and rapamycin (F), or SPO (G). Samples were taken at the indicated time points. Cells were binned in five classes of transcript levels (0 to 5; 6 to 10; 11 to 15; 16 to 20 and 21 or more transcripts per cell) and the percentages of each class contributing to the total population are indicated.\\nIt is worth noting that IME1 mRNA levels decline sharply 12 hours after inhibition of the PKA and TORC1 pathways but remained elevated in cells incubated in SPO medium for the same amount of time (Fig 2B). Given that expression of IME1 is known to decline when cells undergo meiotic divisions, a plausible explanation is that progression into meiosis differs between the two conditions [18]. Indeed, when PKA and TORC1 were inhibited the majority of cells underwent meiotic divisions within 12 hours (see next section for details). In contrast, when cells were directly transferred from YPD medium into SPO medium sporulation did not occur efficiently, and it is likely that many (more than 50%) of the cells were arrested in intermediate stages of meiosis (S1 Table). Therefore a decline in IME1 was not observed at 12 hours (Fig 2B). Finally, we would like to point out that we did not see a decline in pIME1-LacZ reporter activity even when cells progressed into meiosis (Fig 1F). This can be explained by the long half-life of β-galactosidase (more than 20 hours) [19].\\nNext, we analysed IME1 abundance in single cells. We binned the single cell expression data into five classes of transcript levels (0–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20 and 21 or more transcripts). In untreated cells more than 95 percent of cells had no or low levels of IME1, whereas ACT1 was expressed strongly in the majority cells (Fig 2C). In line with previous observations, rapamycin treatment had no effect on IME1 expression (Fig 2D). Interestingly, when PKA was inhibited the majority of cells expressed no or low levels of IME1 (0–5 copies per cell), but approximately 20% of cells expressed high levels of IME1 (21 or more copies per cell) (Fig 2E). When both PKA and TORC1 were inhibited the majority of cells (more than 75%) harboured high levels of IME1 RNA, which was comparable to SPO medium (compare Fig 2F and 2G). These data complement our population based assays and show that inhibition of PKA/TORC1 leads to significant IME1 expression in the majority of cells grown in nutrient-rich conditions.\\nLittle is known about how nutrient signalling controls other aspects of sporulation. To determine the consequences of PKA and TORC1 inhibition on meiotic progression, we examined subsequent stages of meiosis by measuring the kinetics of meiosis in cells shifted to YPD containing inhibitors of PKA and TORC1. Interestingly, less than 15% of cells underwent meiotic divisions when only PKA was inhibited. Given that a significant higher portion of cells were positive for intermediate or high levels of IME1 compared to number of cells that underwent meiotic divisions (Fig 2D and 2E), the result suggests that events downstream of IME1 are perhaps not efficiently induced in these cells. More than 90% of cells underwent meiotic divisions when both PKA and TORC1 were inhibited (Fig 3A). Under this condition cells also formed spores, but 70 percent (224 out 320 spores) of spores formed colonies compared to 95 percent (304 out of 320 spores) for the wild-type cells induced to sporulate in SPO medium. This reduced spore viability was not due to the tpk1-as allele being hypomorphic, because the same strain sporulated efficiently and exhibited 94 percent (301 out of 320 spores) spore viability in SPO medium (Fig 3B). Apart from reduced spore viability, we also observed a strong enrichment for triads in cells treated with PKA/TORC1 inhibitors (Fig 3C). Although four DAPI masses formed during the two meiotic divisions, three were packaged into spores and one nucleus was evicted or degraded from cells (Fig 3C and 3D). We conclude that inhibition of TORC1 and PKA is sufficient to drive entry into and progression through the sporulation program.\\n(A) Kinetics of meiotic divisions (MI + MII) of cells harbouring the tpk1-as allele (FW1762) shifted from YPD to fresh YPD with no treatment (NT) (closed circles), rapamycin (open circles), 1NM-PP1 (closed triangles), or rapamycin/1NM-PP1 (open triangles). Samples were taken at the indicated time point, fixed, and DAPI masses were counted. Cells that contain 2, 3, or 4 DAPI masses were classified as cells that underwent meiosis. For each time point 100 cells were counted. (B) Quantification of sporulation efficiencies in control (FW1511) and tpk1-as (FW1762) diploid cells. Cell were grown overnight in YPD, shifted to pre-sporulation medium, and then transferred to sporulation medium (SPO). Percentages of sporulated cells were determined after 48 hours in SPO. (C-D) Quantification of number of nuclei and spores. Cells harbouring the tpk1-as allele were grown in YPD, shifted to pre-sporulation medium, and subsequently shifted to SPO medium or to YPD plus 1NM-PP1 and rapamycin. The percentage of cells harbouring three or four spores was determined at 24 hours after treatment (C). DAPI labelled nuclei were counted at 10 hours (D, left panel) and 24 hours (D, right panel) after treatment. For each time point, 200 cells were counted.\\nFirst, we analysed how IME1 expression is affected in respiratory deficient cells. Pet100 is required for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase. Yeast cells lacking the PET100 gene cannot respire. In line with previous observations, pet100Δ cells did not induce IME1 in SPO medium (Fig 4A, compare lanes 1–4 to 5–8) [7]. Likewise, cells treated with the drugs antimycin A (antimycin), which inhibits cytochrome c reductase, or oligomycin, which inhibits the Fo subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, did not induce IME1 (Fig 4B, compare lanes 1–4 to 5–8 and 9–12). Uncoupling of respiration from energy production by treating cells with CCCP which disrupts the proton gradient and thus reduces the ability of the ATP synthase to function led to similar results (Fig 4B, compare lanes 1–4 and 13–16). Thus, respiration is required for induction of IME1 expression in sporulation medium.\\n(A) Northern blot analysis of IME1 expression in control (FW1762, lanes 1–4) and pet100Δ mutant (FW1770, lanes 5–8). Cells were grown overnight in YPD medium and shifted to sporulation medium (SPO), and samples were taken at the indicated time points. (B) Similar to A except that cells (FW1762) were grown in pre-sporulation medium before shifted to SPO. Subsequently, cells were either not treated (lanes 1–4), treated with antimycin A (50 μM, lanes 5–8), oligomycin (10 μM, lanes 9–12), or with CCCP (20 μM, lanes 13–16). (C) Similar to A, except that cells were diluted into 1NM-PP1 and rapamycin containing YPD (lanes 1–16), and treated with antimycin A (lanes 5–8) or oligomycin (lanes 9–12). The pet100Δ mutant (lanes 13–16) was also included in the analyses. (D) IME1 promoter activity was measured using a diploid strain harbouring tpk1-as and the IME1 promoter fused to LacZ reporter (FW1976). Cells were grown in YPD overnight, diluted into YPD plus 1NM-PP1/rapamycin or shifted to sporulation medium (SPO) in the presence or absence of oligomycin (10 μM). Samples were taken after 0, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours. β-galactosidase activity was measured using a quantitative liquid ortho-Nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) assay (see Materials and Methods for details). The promoter activities are displayed in Miller Units, and the standard error of the mean of at least two biological experiments is shown. (E) Quantification of IME1 mRNA levels in a strain harbouring the GAL1 promoter fused to IME1 and GAL4-ER (FW3243). Cells were grown in YPD, shifted to pre-sporulation medium, and transferred to SPO in the absence or presence of antimycin A. The GAL1 promoter was activated using estradiol. Total RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, and IME1 mRNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR. Signals were normalized to ACT1 levels. The standard error of the mean of at least two biological experiments is shown. (F) Quantification of sporulation efficiency of strains and treatments described in C. At least n = 200 cells were counted at 48 hours after treatment. Untreated diploid cells were included as a negative control.\\nNext, we induced sporulation by inhibiting PKA and TORC1 in cells grown in glucose-rich medium, and tested whether respiration is required for IME1 expression. To our surprise, IME1 expression levels were comparable between control cells, and antimycin or oligomycin treated cells (Fig 4C, compare lanes 1–4 to 5–8 or 9–12). pet100Δ cells grown in YPD strongly induced IME1 when the PKA and TORC1 pathways were inhibited (Fig 4C, compare lanes 1–4 to 13–16). To further quantify IME1 promoter activity in respiratory deficient cells, we measured pIME1-LacZ reporter expression in oligomycin treated cells. As expected, in SPO medium the IME1 promoter stayed repressed when cells were treated with oligomycin. In YPD plus TORC1 and PKA inhibitors, IME1 expression accumulated with slightly slower kinetics in the presence of oligomycin but peaked to similar levels as control cells (Fig 4D). Finally we examined whether IME1 can be induced from a heterologous promoter in SPO medium when respiration is inhibited (Fig 4E). When we induced IME1 from the GAL1 promoter using a Gal4-estrogen receptor fusion (GAL4-ER) that can be activated by the addition of estradiol, IME1 was strongly induced. However, in cells treated with antimycin IME1 stayed repressed. Previous work showed that expression of mRNAs from different genes is also affected under this condition [7]. We propose that the effects are not specific for IME1, but either transcription or mRNA stability or both are generally affected when cells are starved and cannot respire. Notably, even though cells were able to express IME1 when respiration was inhibited in YPD medium with TORC1 and PKA inhibitors the vast majority of these cells did not complete gametogenesis (Fig 4F) indicating that other stages of sporulation require respiration. In conclusion, when sporulation is induced in the presence of ample nutrients, respiration is not required for IME1 expression. This result suggests that either respiration or fermentation can serve as energy providers for induction of IME1 transcription.\\nOur results show that inhibition of PKA and TORC1 activity is sufficient to initiate entry into sporulation. Although it is well established that PKA signalling inhibits sporulation, inhibition of TORC1 by rapamycin treatment has been reported to affect sporulation with different outcomes. We and others have shown that rapamycin can stimulate sporulation by inducing IME1 expression [7]. Moreover, inactivation of TORC1 was shown to stabilize Ime1 and promotes its nuclear localization [20]. However, others have found that rapamycin can also inhibit spore formation in budding and fission yeast when added to the SPO medium [21, 22]. These seemingly conflicting results prompted us to further examine how rapamycin and TORC1 control sporulation.\\nSch9 is a serine/threonine kinase that controls ribosome biogenesis, autophagy, and entry into stationary phase [31–33]. It is also directly phosphorylated by Tor1 [34]. First, we quantified IME1 promoter activity in sch9Δ mutant cells shifted from YPD to SPO medium. We found that IME1 promoter activity was only slightly higher in sch9Δ cells compared to control cells (Fig 7A). We next measured IME1 promoter activity in cells grown in rich medium using the tpk1-as allele. Upon inhibition of PKA, IME1 promoter activity was overall higher and accumulated with faster kinetics in sch9Δ cells compared to control cells (Fig 7B). These data indicate that Sch9 is a repressor of IME1. If Sch9 is the only downstream target of TORC1 that represses IME1 than lowering TORC1 activity in sch9Δ cells should not further affect IME1 expression. Indeed, rapamycin treatment did not further increase IME1 promoter activity in sch9Δ cells (Fig 7B, compare pink bars with light green bars). These results indicate that Sch9 mediates repression of IME1 by TORC1.\\n(A) IME1 promoter activity was measured in strains harbouring tpk1-as and pIME1-LacZ (control, FW1976) and sch9Δ (FW2498). Cells were grown in YPD overnight shifted to SPO and samples were taken at the indicated time points. β-galactosidase activity was measured using a quantitative liquid ortho-Nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) assay (see Materials and Methods for details). The promoter activities are displayed in Miller Units, and the standard error of the mean of at least two biological experiments is shown. (B) Similar to A except that cells were diluted into YPD with 1NM-PP1 or 1NM-PP1 plus rapamycin. (C) IME1 transcript distribution among single cells in control (FW1762), tco89Δ (FW1966) and sch9Δ (FW2437) strains (all in tpk1-as background). After 8 hours treatment with 1NM-PP1, cells were fixed, hybridized with probes directed against IME1 (AF594) and ACT1 (Cy5). Finally, cells were imaged and transcript levels were quantified (see Materials and Methods for details). ACT1 was used as an internal control and only cells positive for ACT1 were selected for the analysis. At least 120 cells (n = 120) were quantified. The error bars represent the standard error of the mean of two biological experiments. (D) Same treatments and strains as A and B, but here the percentage of cells that underwent meiotic divisions (MI+MII) was determined after 48 hours of treatment.\\nTo further analyse how Sch9 controls sporulation we measured IME1 levels in single cells by smFISH. We observed that in sch9Δ cells treated with PKA inhibitors the majority (more than 60%) of cells expressed more than 21 copies per cell (Fig 7C). Only a small fraction of cells did not induce IME1. Furthermore, the IME1 mRNA distribution pattern in sch9Δ cells closely resembled that of tco89Δ cells, which supports our finding that TORC1 repression of IME1 is mediated by Sch9. Finally, we measured how meiosis is affected in sch9Δ cells. In line with the IME1 expression data, the percentage of cells that completed meiosis was significantly higher (60% versus less than 20% in the control) in sch9Δ cells treated with PKA inhibitor (Fig 7D). In addition, in sch9Δ cells shifted from YPD to SPO the percentage of cells that underwent meiosis was substantially higher than in wild-type cells induced to sporulate under these conditions (90% versus 20%). Given that we only observed a small increase in IME1 under this conditions (Fig 7A), the result suggests that Sch9 may also inhibit meiotic progression downstream of IME1 induction and regulate events such as IME2 and NTD80 induction. In conclusion, TORC1-Sch9 signalling contributes to repressing IME1 expression and entry in sporulation in nutrients-rich conditions.\\nWe next tested whether Tup1-Cyc8 association with the IME1 promoter is important for IME1 repression. We found that Tup1 depletion was sufficient for the activation of the IME1 promoter (Fig 8D). In diploids cells harbouring a TUP1-AID fusion and expressing pTEF1-osTIR1, IME1 promoter activity (pIME1-LacZ) increased after treatment with IAA. In contrast, β-galactosidase expression was not induced in untreated cells or cells that only expressed Tup1-AID. Finally, we compared the level of IME1 induction between Tup1 depleted cells, wild type starved cells (SPO medium), and cells treated with PKA and TORC1 inhibitors grown in rich medium (Fig 8E). Overall IME1 promoter activity was similar under the different conditions, but increased more rapidly in Tup1 depleted cells compared to cells starved in SPO medium or treated with PKA and TORC1 inhibitors. We conclude that Tup1-Cyc8 is a key repressor of the IME1 promoter, and that PKA and TORC1 control Tup1 association with the IME1 promoter.\\nIn general, cells were grown overnight in YPD to saturation (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) at 30°C, then diluted to fresh YPD (OD600 = 1) and treated with different drugs or shifted to sporulation medium (SPO, 0.3% potassium acetate, 0.002% raffinose, pH 7.0). In some experiments cells were grown overnight in YPD, diluted to pre-sporulation medium (BYTA, 1% yeast extract, 2% tryptone, 1% potassium acetate, 50 mM potassium phtlhalate) for 16 hours, and subsequently shifted to YPD or SPO [62]. Rapamycin was added to cells in a final concentration of 1000 ng/μl unless written otherwise. 1NM-PP1 was added to cells in a final concentration of 3 μM.\\n(A) Cells harbouring the tpk1M164G, tpk2Δ, tpk3Δ alleles (tpk1-as, FW1762) were grown in YPD overnight, diluted to 0.2 (OD600), and subsequently cells were treated with 1NM-PP1, rapamycin, both or untreated. Cell density (OD600) was measured over time at the indicated time points. (B) IME1 promoter activity was measured in a diploid control strain harbouring the IME1 promoter fused to LacZ reporter (pIME1-LacZ) (FW612), and a strain harbouring tpk1-as and pIME1-LacZ (FW1976). Cells were grown in YPD overnight, shifted to sporulation medium (SPO), and samples were taken at the indicated time point. β-galactosidase activity was measured using a quantitative liquid ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) assay (see Materials and Methods for details). The promoter activities are displayed in Miller Units, and the standard error of the mean of at least two biological experiments is shown. (C) Similar as B except that IME1 tpk1-as (FW1976) cells were diluted into YPD and treated with rapamycin (1000 ng/ml), 1NM-PP1, or both compounds, or shifted to SPO. Samples were taken after 0, 1, 2, and 4 hours. (D) Similar to C, except that samples shifted to YP-acetate (YPA), YPA plus rapamycin or YPA plus 1NM-PP1.\\n', 'Osteotomies including pedicle subtraction (PSO) and/or Smith-Peterson (SPO) are used to facilitate surgical correction of adult spinal deformity (ASD), but are associated with complications including instrumentation failure and rod fracture (RF). The purpose of this study was to determine incidence and risk factors for RF, including a clinically significant subset (CSRF), after osteotomy for ASD.\\nIncidence rates of RF were: for entire population, 9.3\\xa0% (95 % Cl: 2.7\\xa0%; 15.9\\xa0%); for PSO, 16.2\\xa0% (95 % Cl: 4.3; 28.1); and for SPO, 2.6\\xa0% (95 % Cl: 0\\xa0%; 7.7\\xa0%); the OR of PSO versus SPO was 7.2 (95 % Cl: 0.8; 62.7, P\\u2009=\\u20090.1). CSRF incidence was 5.3\\xa0% (95 % CI: 0.2\\xa0%; 10.4\\xa0%). Significant risk of RF was revealed for following factors: fusion construct crossing both thoracolumbar and lumbosacral junctions (OR\\u2009=\\u20099.1, P\\u2009=\\u20090.05), sagittal rod contour >60° (OR\\u2009=\\u200910.0, P\\u2009=\\u20090.04); the presence of dominos and/or parallel connectors at date of rod fracture (OR\\u2009=\\u200910.0, P\\u2009=\\u20090.01); and pseudarthrosis at ≥1\\xa0year follow-up (OR\\u2009=\\u200928.9, P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Statistically significant risk of CSRF was revealed for fusion to pelvis (P\\u2009=\\u20090.05) and pseudarthrosis at ≥1\\xa0year follow-up (OR\\u2009=\\u200950.3, CI: 4.2; 598.8, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01).\\nAdult spinal deformity (ASD) is a debilitating condition that often requires surgical correction. The aging population, combined with an increasing number of spine fusion procedures, is increasing the prevalence of ASD [1, 2]. Osteotomy procedures, including Smith-Peterson (SPO) and pedicle subtraction (PSO) are effective procedures used to correct deformity and lead to improved clinical outcomes [3–6]. One important difference between these osteotomies is that SPOs only involve resection of the posterior column of the spine while PSOs involve a greater resection including the pedicle and wedge of vertebral body [7, 8]. As a result, one PSO can achieve greater correction (30–40°) than a single SPO (approximately 10°) [9–13]. Due to the physical differences in osteotomies, it would seem plausible that after PSO vs. SPO the spine and fusion construct would be subjected to different strains and subsequent complications. However, while mechanical complications after PSO have been well described, these complications after SPO haven’t specifically been of focus. Multiple authors have described increased complications [4, 6, 14–16], pseudarthrosis [3, 4, 14, 15, 17], and instrumentation failure including rod fracture (RF) in PSO patients [4, 6, 14, 18]. Of note, rod fracture often requires reoperation and studies have postulated a link between pseudarthrosis and RF [4, 6, 14, 18]. However, prior studies have not statistically confirmed this linkage due to study limitations.\\nRod fracture can be differentiated into two main subgroups: clinically significant rod fracture (CSRF) and non-CSRF (CSRF was termed “symptomatic rod fracture” in a previous study) [18]. CSRF can be defined as symptoms prompting evaluation (e.g., pain, neurological symptoms) and diagnosis of fractured rods via radiographic imaging or re-operation. CSRFs are often accompanied with radiographic signs of pseudarthrosis, new symptoms such as pain or radiculopathy, or resulting in loss of correction [18], while non-CSRFs by definition aren’t associated with patient symptoms or loss of correction. Previous studies have found that the incidence of RF varies widely after spinal correction, with a recent study citing a post-PSO incidence of 22\\xa0% for all RF including non-CSRF and CSRF [4, 14, 18, 19]. The largest study to date studying CSRF only, reported a lower incidence rate of 6.8\\xa0% in a population of ASD patients treated with long, >5 level posterior instrumented fusion, with a higher incidence in a subset of patients who underwent osteotomy at 15.8\\xa0% [18]. Of note, no large series to date has cited the incidence of RF and CSRF subset in a combined cohort of adult spinal deformity patients treated with either PSO and/or SPO and compared the incidence between the two procedures.\\nAfter institutional review board approval (COMIRB #14-1258), data was analyzed from 104 consecutive patients who underwent an instrumented posterolateral spinal fusion including a SPO, PSO, or combination for adult spinal deformity between 2007 and 2014 by 4 surgeons at a single institution. Inclusion criteria consisted of: 1) >18\\xa0years of age; 2) diagnosis of adult spinal deformity including the following etiologies: fixed sagittal imbalance, idiopathic and degenerative scoliosis or kyphosis, posttraumatic kyphosis, idiopathic flat back syndrome, and ankylosing spondylitis; 3) operation consisting of ≥2 level instrumented posterolateral fusion with lumbar or thoracic spinal osteotomy (PSO and/or SPO) with or without interbody fusion for spinal deformity; and 4) follow-up for up to 7\\xa0years. Exclusion criteria consisted of: 1) osteotomy procedure for other diseases such as: tumor or infection; and 2) latest follow-up <1\\xa0year unless re-operation for rod fracture 3) secondary operation with manipulation of instrumentation during first postoperative year, for reasons other than rod fracture (e.g., infection with primary instrumentation removal or exchange). These patients were excluded from risk factor analysis because their variables couldn’t serve as a uniform comparison against cases of RF. This thought was based on the possibility that the original rods could have been replaced or subject to different additional stressors (e.g., addition of iliac bolts during subsequent operation) than were primarily documented. Further, radiographic detection of callus ossification after fusion surgery typically requires 9–12\\xa0months. Thus, it could impact evaluation of a risk associated with pseudarthrosis. CSRF was defined as a combination of symptoms prompting evaluation (as described below) and radiographic and/or intraoperative evaluation, if re-operation was completed. The main clinical criteria included: new symptoms such as pain, neurological symptoms, prominence of instrumentation, or worsening of spinal deformity or loss of correction. Other symptoms prompting evaluation included an audible or tactile “pop.” Radiographic diagnosis included rod irregularities suggesting a crack or discontinuation of rod contour (Fig.\\xa01: a; b), particularly if accompanied by radiographic suspicion of pseudarthrosis. Pseudarthrosis was initially diagnosed via helical CT with sagittal and coronal reconstruction and confirmed intra-operatively via detection of spine movement between motion segments within the fusion mass.\\nSurgical variables: number of posterior levels fused, location of fused levels, fusion to sacrum, pelvic fixation, osteotomy type (SPO or PSO), and osteotomy location. It should be noted that all patients received bone grafting posteriorly, and were classified as posterolateral fusions. The specific type of bone grafting was not analyzed;\\nAll patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were included for RF and CSRF incidence analysis. Patients were then divided into SPO and PSO subgroups to determine incidence by osteotomy type. If patients had both SPOs and PSO, they were included in the PSO group only.\\nIn our case-series, incidence of RF was 9.3\\xa0% (95 % Cl:2.7\\xa0%; 15.9\\xa0%) with 7/75 patients experiencing fractures. By subtype 4/7 were classified as CSRF, resulting in CSRF incidence of 5.3\\xa0% (9 5% CI: 0.2\\xa0%; 10.4\\xa0%). When separated by osteotomy type, the RF incidence rate trended higher if operation included PSO (6/37, 16.2\\xa0%, 95 % Cl: 4.3\\xa0%; 28.1\\xa0%) versus SPO only (1/38, 2.6\\xa0%, 95 % Cl: 0\\xa0%; 7.7\\xa0%), but this difference was found to have borderline significance (OR\\u2009=\\u20097.2 95\\xa0% CI: 0.8; 62.7, P\\u2009=\\u20090.1). When CSRFs were separated by osteotomy type, the CSRF trended higher if operation included PSO (3/37, 8.1\\xa0%, 95 % CI: 0\\xa0%; 16.9\\xa0%) versus SPO only (1/38, 2.6\\xa0%, 95 % CI: 0\\xa0%; 7.7\\xa0%). The 3 non-CSRFs were not associated with symptoms, pseudarthrosis, and didn’t require re-operation. Six of 7 patients experienced unilateral rod fracture and 1 patient experienced bilateral rod fractures.\\nAmong surgical variables, fusion construct crossing 2 spine junctions (thoracolumbar and lumbosacral) was found to be a risk factor for RF with an OR of 9.1 (95 % CI: 1.0; 80.0, P\\u2009=\\u20090.05), Table\\xa03. A few other surgical variables having relatively high risk showed only borderline statistical significance (0.05\\u2009>\\u2009P\\u2009<\\u20090.2), in particular: osteotomy type - PSO vs. SPO (OR\\u2009=\\u20097.2, 95\\xa0% CI: 0.8; 62.7); fusion to sacrum (OR\\u2009=\\u2009N/A, P\\u2009=\\u20090.1); fusion to pelvis (OR\\u2009=\\u20093.2, 95 % CI: 0.70; 15.6); and ≥8 levels fused vs. <8 levels fused (OR\\u2009=\\u20093.8, 95\\xa0% CI: 0.4; 33.4), Table\\xa03. Surgical variables that did not show significant association with RF were primary surgeon, osteotomy location, use of navigation systems (navigation vs. non-navigation), and presence of interbody support postop.\\nThis study is a case-series of 75 consecutive ASD patients assessed for incidence and risk factors for RF and CSRF after instrumented posterior fusion and osteotomy (SPO and PSO). Total incidence of RF was 9.3\\xa0% with 16.2\\xa0% after PSO and 2.6\\xa0% after SPO. Clinically significant total rod fracture rate was 5.3\\xa0% and post-PSO rate was 8.1\\xa0%. Following risk factor analysis, statistically significant risk factors for RF were obtained: fusion construct crossing 2 spine junctions, sagittal rod contour >60°, presence of dominos and/or parallel connectors at date of fracture, and pseudarthrosis at ≥1\\xa0year follow-up. Statistically significant risk factors for the clinically significant subset were fusion to pelvis and pseudarthrosis at ≥1\\xa0year follow-up. Interestingly, most variables with increased risk, including those meeting statistical significance or borderline significance, were similar between total RF group and CSRF subset. However, due to the low number of only 4 CSRFs, most variables only met borderline significance.\\nSurgical variable risk factors meeting statistical or borderline significance for RF and CSRF included: fusion constructs crossing two junctions and fusion to the pelvis. In prior studies, fusion across junctional regions of the spine, lumbosacral or thoraco-lumbar has been shown to be a risk factor for complications and increased strain on instrumentation [9, 14, 30, 32]. However, pelvic fixation alone has not been previously described as having association with RF. We propose that the association between CSRF and pelvic fixation could be the result of a few possible underlying etiologies. First, pelvic fixation may be a confounder to fusion across the lumbosacral junction of the spine, as pelvic fixation can only be present in those with fusion across the lumbosacral junction. Supporting evidence showed a high risk, with borderline significance, toward a greater proportion of RF and CSRF subjects with fusion to the sacrum compared to non-CSRF subjects. Alternatively, pelvic fixation alone may increase rod strain as pelvic fixation has been shown to increase overall spinal construct stiffness, but may inflict pinpoint strain on the rods [35]. Supporting evidence is seen with multiple rods fracturing near or at iliac bolt connector. Lastly, an extremely unbalanced spine requiring additional support can be a factor necessitating pelvic fixation and thus contributing to rod stress. Therefore, a spine with a high degree of imbalance at baseline, rather than the pelvic fixation alone, may explain the association between CSRF and pelvic fixation. Supporting literature found increased risk for RF with increased baseline sagittal imbalance and increased SVA correction [19]. Another surgical variable showing increased risk for RF, but only meeting borderline significance, was osteotomy type - PSO vs. SPO. Prior studies haven’t quantified this risk. However, PSOs have a couple factors that may increase rod strain including absence of pedicle screws at PSO level and greater degree of correction obtained with PSO vs. SPO.\\nThe incidence of rod fracture varies depending on impact of different confounders. This study found incidence rates of 9.3\\xa0% for all RFs, 16.2\\xa0% for all RF after PSO, 2.6\\xa0% for all RF after SPO, 5.3\\xa0% for all CSRFs, and 8.1\\xa0% for CSRF after PSO.\\n', 'a Schematic displaying how TFs and Tup1–Cyc8 could interact at the IME1 promoter. TF =\\xa0transcription factor. b Diploid cells harbouring TUP1-AID and V5-tagged TFs (YAP6-V5, FW4214; SOK2-V5, FW4218; PHD1-V5, FW5056; MOT3-V5, FW4229; NRG1-V5, FW4230; NRG2-V5, FW5055; SKO1-V5, FW4224) were grown to exponential phase. As a control, TUP1-AID (FW5057) cells were also included, which also harbour a V5 tag. Cells were either treated with IAA or DMSO, and the binding of each transcription factor was determined by ChIP and normalised over HMR. Mean of n\\u2009=\\u20092 is shown. c Binding of Tup1 is affected in cells lacking transcription factor binding motifs in the IME1 promoter. Diploid cells with a chromosomal deletion of the IME1 locus, and an integrated plasmid that contained the full IME1 gene fused with sfGFP at the amino terminus and the wild-type promoter (pIME1-WT, FW5370) or the same construct with all the candidate motif sequences mutated (pIME1-bsΔ, FW5372) were used for the analysis. These cells also expressed TUP1-V5. The binding of Tup1 was determined by ChIP. Mean and SEM of n\\u2009=\\u20093 are shown. d Expression of Ime1 during entry into meiosis in pIME1-WT and pIME1-bsΔ cells. Strains described in c were grown till saturation in rich medium (YPD), grown for an additional 16–18\\u2009h in pre-sporulation medium (BYTA), and subsequently shifted to sporulation medium (SPO). The levels of Ime1 expression were determined by imaging and quantifying the fluorescent signals generated by sfGFP-Ime1 in single cells (n\\u2009=\\u200950 cells per sample). The mean of signals detected and error bars representing the 95% confidence interval are displayed. Unpaired parametric two-tailed Welch’s t test with 95% confidence was used and p values (** = ≤0.01, *** = ≤0.001) are indicated.\\nThe Tup1–Cyc8 complex dissociates from the IME1 promoter in cells exposed to nutrient starvation16. We hypothesised that TFs interacting with Tup1–Cyc8 at the IME1 promoter control Tup1–Cyc8 dissociation during IME1 activation. To examine this, we measured the binding of the TFs during activation of the IME1 promoter. In order to induce IME1 expression and meiotic entry, we typically grow cells in rich medium conditions containing glucose until saturation, then shift to pre-sporulation medium containing acetate to ensure that cells are not subjected to repressive glucose signalling to the IME1 promoter4,9. Subsequently, cells are starved in sporulation (SPO) medium (0.3% acetate), which induces IME1 transcription and meiotic entry. Both Pog1 and Tup1 were enriched at 0\\u2009h in SPO prior to IME1 induction. As expected, during meiotic entry (4\\u2009h in SPO) Tup1 dissociated from the IME1 promoter completely while Pog1 binding was maintained albeit to a reduced level (Fig.\\xa06a, right panel). In addition, we found that all eight TFs were enriched at the IME1 promoter prior to induction of IME1 (Fig.\\xa06a, left panel). Upon entry into meiosis (4\\u2009h in SPO), five TFs showed near background binding (less than three-fold) to the IME1 promoter, while three TFs (Yap6, Phd1 and Nrg1) displayed marginal enrichment (less than five-fold over background) (Fig.\\xa06a, right panel). We further performed a time course experiment with three TFs (Yap6/Sok2/Phd1) and Tup1. We found that IME1 bulk expression levels peaked at 3\\u2009h in SPO (Supplementary Fig.\\xa06a). Tup1 and Sok2 dissociated from the IME1 promoter in the early time points (1 and 2\\u2009h in SPO), while the majority of Tup1 and Sok2 was evicted at 4\\u2009h in SPO (Fig.\\xa06b). Yap6 and Phd1 displayed reduced binding at the IME1 promoter at 3\\u2009h in SPO and was thus slower than Sok2 and Tup1. We propose that the gradual dissociation of multiple TFs evicts Tup1–Cyc8 from the IME1 promoter.\\na Binding of TFs at the IME1 promoter prior to and during entry into meiosis. Diploid cells harbouring V5 tagged TFs (YAP6-V5, FW3833; PHD1-V5, FW4466; NRG1-V5, FW4393; SOK2-V5, FW5638; MOT3-V5, FW4383; SKO1-V5, FW4389; NRG2-V5, FW4396; SUT1-V5, FW6974; TUP1-V5, FW3456; POG1-V5, FW968) and control cells (untagged, FW1511) were used for the analyses. Samples for ChIP were taken at 0 and 4\\u2009h in SPO. Mean and SEM values of n\\u2009=\\u20093 is displayed, except for control (n\\u2009=\\u20092). b Similar as in a, except that multiple time points were taken to analyse the timing of dissociation of Tup1-V5, Yap6-V5, Sok2-V5 and Phd1-V5 from the IME1 promoter. ChIP signals were normalised over HMR, and the 0\\u2009h time point was set to 100%. The mean and SEM values of n\\u2009=\\u20093 (Tup1–V5), and the mean of n\\u2009=\\u20092 (Yap6-V5, Sok2-V5 and Phd1-V5) are displayed. c Nuclear signal of Yap6-mNG (FW7473), Sok2-mNG (FW7475), Phd1-mNG (FW7477), Tup1-mNG (FW7644) and Cyc8-mNG (FW7642) prior to (0\\u2009h in SPO) and during entry into meiosis (4\\u2009h in SPO). Each transcription factor was fused to mNeonGreen (mNG). These cells also expressed mCherry fused to SV40 nuclear localisation signal (NLS) (mCherry-NLS). As a control, the signals of cells harbouring no mNG-tag (FW5199) are displayed. The black bar indicates the mean signal, and each point indicates a single cell measurement (n\\u2009=\\u200950 for each sample). The error bars represent the 95% confidence interval.\\nOne possible mechanism by which Tup1–Cyc8 and TFs dissociate from the IME1 promoter is by re-localisation to the cytoplasm. Indeed, nutrient signalling via PKA and TORC1 can impact the localisation of several TFs42,43. We fused mNeonGreen to Sok2, Phd1, Yap6, Tup1 and Cyc8 (Supplementary Fig.\\xa06b). As expected, Sok2, Phd1 and Yap6 were concentrated in the nucleus. Neither protein abundance in the nucleus nor the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios were altered in cells prior to (0\\u2009h in SPO) and during entry into meiosis (4\\u2009h in SPO) (Fig.\\xa06c, Supplementary Fig.\\xa06c). Taken together, activation of the IME1 promoter correlates with dissociation of Tup1–Cyc8 and Tup1–Cyc8 recruiting TFs from the IME1 promoter, but likely not via a mechanism involving re-localisation of TFs to the cytoplasm.\\nOur observations indicate that Sok2, Phd1 and Yap6 are important TFs for IME1 repression. Next, we investigated how the three TFs control Tup1–Cyc8 recruitment in different nutrient conditions. We found that Tup1 binding to the IME1 promoter was not decreased by sok2∆, phd1∆ and yap6∆ single/double/triple deletions in rich medium containing glucose, suggesting that other TFs contribute to IME1 repression via Tup1–Cyc8 when glucose is used by cells as the carbon source (Fig.\\xa07a). In contrast, prior to meiotic entry (0\\u2009h in SPO) Tup1 binding was diminished in sok2Δ and sok2Δphd1Δ cells, but not in yap6Δ and phd1Δ cells (Fig.\\xa07a). Strikingly, Tup1 association with the IME1 promoter was severely reduced (less than three-fold over background) in sok2Δyap6Δ and sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells at 0\\u2009h in SPO. IME1 expression was inversely correlated with Tup1–Cyc8 recruitment to the IME1 promoter since IME1 was significantly de-repressed in sok2Δyap6Δ, sok2Δphd1Δ or sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells at 0\\u2009h in SPO (Fig.\\xa07b). Finally, we examined how Sok2, Phd1 and Yap6 mediated Tup1–Cyc8 recruitment contributes to the onset of meiotic entry. Cells harbouring sok2Δ or sok2Δphd1Δ underwent meiosis much faster than wild-type cells (Fig.\\xa07c). There was little effect on the onset of meiosis in the yap6Δ or yap6Δphd1Δ mutants. In sok2Δyap6Δ and sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells the kinetics of meiosis was slightly faster than sok2Δphd1Δ cells (Fig.\\xa07c). Approximately 50% of cells underwent meiotic divisions within 2\\u2009h in SPO for sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells compared to 3\\u2009h for sok2Δphd1Δ cells. We also analysed how the onset of meiosis is affected in sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δnrg1Δ cells (Supplementary Fig.\\xa07a). We found no difference in the onset of meiosis between sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δnrg1Δ and sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells, suggesting that Nrg1 is not involved in IME1 activation (Fig.\\xa06a, right panel). We conclude that Sok2, Phd1 and Yap6 direct Tup1–Cyc8 association with the IME1 promoter to ensure timely expression of IME1 in cells grown in acetate-containing medium. Our data further suggest that the IME1 promoter is regulated by multiple Tup1–Cyc8 co-repressor complexes.\\na Tup1 binding at the IME1 promoter in nutrient rich conditions (YPD) and prior to entry into meiosis (0\\u2009h in SPO) in wild-type cells (FW3456) or cells harbouring sok2Δ, phd1Δ and yap6Δ single deletions (FW3979, FW3991, FW3603); sok2Δphd1Δ, yap6Δphd1Δ and sok2Δyap6Δ double deletions (FW4710, FW4406, FW4239); and sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ triple deletions (FW4010). An untagged control (FW1511) was also included in the analyses. The mean and SEM values of n\\u2009=\\u20093 is displayed, except for sok2Δ, phd1Δ and the untagged control for which the mean of n\\u2009=\\u20092 is displayed. b\\nIME1 expression in deletion mutants described in (a). The signals were normalised over the ACT1 gene signals. Mean and SEM values of n\\u2009=\\u20093 are displayed. Two-way ANOVA analysis was carried out using the uncorrected Fisher’s LSD method with 95% confidence to compare IME1 expression in mutant cells against wild-type control cells at SPO 0\\u2009h. Non-significant (ns) and p values (** = ≤0.01, *** = ≤0.001, **** = ≤0.0001) are indicated. c Meiosis in mutant strains described in (a). Samples were taken at the indicated time points, fixed and DAPI masses were counted (n\\u2009=\\u2009200–300 cells per sample) to determine the percentage of cells that underwent meiosis (MI\\u2009+\\u2009MII). Cells harbouring two, three or four DAPI masses were classified as meiosis.\\nWhy do so many TFs (at least eight) associate with the IME1 promoter? One possibility is that the TFs facilitate Tup1–Cyc8 recruitment under different nutrient conditions. With this logic, repression of the IME1 promoter can be maintained under various nutrient conditions and will only be fully activated when all the nutrient signalling requirements are met. In agreement with this model, IME1 expression was only marginally increased in sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells grown in the presence of ample nutrients with glucose as the carbon source (YPD), and was significantly increased by nearly ten-fold in sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells grown in acetate-containing medium (Figs.\\xa05a, b and 7b). Furthermore, in YPD saturation when glucose is depleted from the growth medium, we observed that some TFs displayed altered association with the IME1 promoter. For example, Sok2 binding was increased, while Yap6 and Cyc8 association with the IME1 promoter was decreased (Supplementary Fig.\\xa07b). To examine how the different TFs respond to nutrient signalling at the IME1 promoter more systematically, we measured their association under different nutrient conditions (Fig.\\xa08a). We grew cells until the pre-sporulation stage, and subsequently shifted cells to sporulation medium (SPO) (1), SPO plus 2% glucose (2), YP (3) or YP plus 2% glucose (YPD) (4). First, we measured Tup1 association with the IME1 promoter. We found that in SPO plus glucose, Tup1 binding to the IME1 promoter was partially restored (Fig.\\xa08b). The association of Tup1 with the IME1 promoter was further increased in YP and was the highest in YPD growth medium. Pog1, the transcriptional activator of IME1, was enriched in all four nutrient conditions, but at higher levels in YP and YPD (Fig.\\xa08b). Interestingly, TFs important for Tup1–Cyc8 recruitment to the IME1 promoter responded to nutrient signals in distinct ways (Fig.\\xa08c). For example, Yap6, Sok2, Sko1 and Nrg1 associated with the IME1 promoter in response to the nutrient cues present in YP, but not to glucose signals alone. Phd1 binding partially recovered in the presence of glucose and showed the strongest enrichment in cells exposed to YP and YPD. Conversely, glucose signalling, but not YP, maintained association of Mot3 and Nrg2 with the IME1 promoter (Fig.\\xa08c). Finally, Sut1 association with the IME1 promoter was restored in YPD only.\\na Schematic of the experimental set up. Following growth in YPD and pre-sporulation medium, cells were shifted to SPO, SPO plus 2% glucose, YP or YP plus 2% glucose for 4\\u2009h. b Binding of Tup1 and Pog1 at the IME1 promoter under distinct nutrient conditions described in (a), as measured by ChIP. Diploid cells harbouring V5 tagged Tup1 (FW3456) or Pog1 (FW968) were used for the analyses. Normalised mean signals and SEM of n\\u2009=\\u20093 are displayed, except for Pog1-V5 in SPO plus 2% glucose, YP and YPD conditions for which the mean of n\\u2009=\\u20092 is shown. c Similar to b, except that V5 tagged Yap6, Sok2, Phd1, Nrg1, Mot3, Nrg2, Sko1 and Sut1 were used for the analyses (FW3833, FW5638, FW4466, FW4393, FW4383, FW4396, FW4389 and FW6974). Mean signals and SEM of n\\u2009=\\u20093 are displayed, except for Sut1-V5 for SPO plus 2% glucose, YP and YPD conditions for which the mean of n\\u2009=\\u20092 is shown. d Similar to b, except that Tup1 binding to the IME1 promoter was determined in the sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells (FW4010). Mean signals for n\\u2009=\\u20092 are displayed, except for 0\\u2009h in SPO for which the mean and SEM of n\\u2009=\\u20093 are shown. e Model for how nutrient signalling controls the IME1 promoter. Multiple Tup1–Cyc8 recruiting TFs associate in nutrient rich conditions with the IME1 promoter. During partial starvation some TFs dissociate from the IME1 promoter, but Tup1–Cyc8 remains bound. Upon entry into meiosis all TFs and Tup1–Cyc8 dissociate, and consequently IME1 transcription is induced.\\nGiven that Sok2, Phd1 and Yap6 were strongly enriched in cells exposed to YP medium (Fig.\\xa08c), we hypothesised that Tup1–Cyc8 association with the IME1 promoter is affected in sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells in YP, but not in SPO containing glucose. We therefore examined how Tup1–Cyc8 association with the IME1 promoter was affected in sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells under different nutrient conditions. Indeed, in sok2Δphd1Δyap6Δ cells, Tup1 binding was detected in SPO plus glucose, but not in YP medium (Fig.\\xa08d). These data indicate that Sok2, Phd1 and Yap6 are important for mediating Tup1–Cyc8 association in YP, while other TFs are required for glucose signalling to the IME1 promoter (Fig.\\xa08e). In summary, our analyses revealed that the association of one set of TFs (i.e., Mot3 and Nrg2) with the IME1 promoter is induced by glucose signalling, while another set of TFs (i.e., Yap6, Sok2, Phd1, Sko1 and Nrg1) was recruited to the IME1 promoter primarily in response to the nutrient cues in YP. Thus, only when all the required nutrient signalling pathways are repressed, all TFs interacting with Tup1–Cyc8 dissociate from the IME1 promoter allowing activation of IME1 transcription. These data show that TFs important for Tup1–Cyc8 recruitment to the IME1 promoter respond to different environmental cues to ensure Tup1–Cyc8 mediated repression under various nutrient conditions.\\nYeast cells were grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) supplemented with 96\\u2009µg/mL tryptophan, 24\\u2009µg/mL uracil and 12\\u2009µg/mL adenine, grown at 30\\u2009°C and liquid cultures were agitated at 300 r.p.m. To obtain exponentially growing cells (YPD (E)) and cells grown to saturation (YPD (S)), cells were grown in YPD to saturation overnight, diluted to OD600\\u2009=\\u20090.2 and subsequently YPD (E) cells were harvested after two to three doublings. YPD (S) cells were grown for 20–24\\u2009h in YPD. To induce entry into meiosis, cells were grown overnight in YPD, shifted to pre-sporulation medium BYTA (1% yeast extract, 2% tryptone, 1% potassium acetate, 50\\u2009mM potassium phthalate) at OD600\\u2009=\\u20090.4 for 16–18\\u2009h, and subsequently transferred to sporulation medium SPO (0.3% potassium acetate, 0.02% raffinose, pH 7.0) at OD600\\u2009=\\u20091.8.\\nTo study the responses of the TFs in distinct nutrient conditions in Fig.\\xa08b–d, cells were grown in YPD and pre-sporulation medium following the standard sporulation induction protocol. Subsequently, cells were shifted to four different types of media including sporulation medium (SPO), glucose-only medium (SPO\\u2009+\\u20092% glucose), YP medium without glucose (YP\\u2009+\\u20090.05% glucose) and YPD medium (YP\\u2009+\\u20092% glucose). Yeast cells were harvested for ChIP analyses at the point of shift (0\\u2009h SPO) and after four hours in the different nutrient conditions.\\nFor determining the localisation of mNeonGreen-tagged TFs described in Fig.\\xa06c. and Supplementary Fig.\\xa06c, cells were induced to sporulate with the standard protocol. Subsequently, cells were imaged at 0\\u2009h in SPO and 4\\u2009h in SPO. Images were acquired using the same imaging system and set up described for quantification of sfGFP expressed in pIME1-WT and pIME1-bs∆ cells. Signals from whole cell and cell nucleus were quantified in the ImageJ 1.52a software and with use of the nuclear marker (2xmCherry-SV40NLS)60. Signal from the cytosol was inferred from the difference between whole cell signal and nuclear signal.\\n', '[Spectrometric investigation of the antioxidant activity of a novel synthetic selenadiazole derivative SPO against DPPH and ABTS free radicals].\\nThe antioxidant activity of a novel synthetic selenadiazole derivative SPO against DPPH and ABTS free radicals was evaluated using spectrometric methods. The results show that the detection wavelength and stable time for DPPH system were 515 nm and 30 min respectively, while those for ABTS system were 734 nm and 6 min, respectively. SPO could effectively and rapidly inhibited the formation of ABTS and DPPH free radicals in a dose- and time-dependent manner, indicating the potent antioxidant activity of SPO under both hydrophilic and hydrophobic conditions. In the optimized systems, the IC50 values of SPO were 85.2 micromol x L(-1) (DPPH assay) and 36.5 micromol x L(-1) (ABTS assay), respectively, which were comparable with the standard antioxidant Trolox, and significantly better than the positive controls BHA and BHT. Taken together, our results suggest the potential applications of selenadiazole derivatives as antioxidative agents.\\n', 'A specific secondary phosphine oxide (SPO) ligand (tert-butyl(phenyl)phosphine oxide) was employed to generate two iridium catalysts, an Ir-SPO complex and IrNPs (iridium nanoparticles) ligated with SPO ligands, which were compared mutually and with several supported iridium catalysts with the aim to establish the differences in their catalytic properties. The Ir-SPO-based catalysts showed totally different activities and selectivities in the hydrogenation of various substituted aldehydes, in which H 2  is likely cleaved by a metal-ligand cooperation, that is, the SPO ligand and a neighboring metal centre operate in tandem to activate the hydrogen molecule. In addition, the supported IrNPs behave very differently from both Ir-SPO catalysts. This study exemplifies perfectly the advantages and disadvantages related to the use of the main types of catalysts, and thus the dissimilarities between them.\\n', \"Retrospective analysis. To compare radiographical analysis and clinical outcomes of spinal osteotomy techniques, including Smith-Petersen osteotomy (SPO), pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO), and vertebral column resection (VCR), and analyze the relationship between preoperative evaluation and postoperative complication incidence. These 3 techniques have been extensively reported previously, whereas, few literatures are available on comparing these 3 techniques in management of severe pediatric spinal deformity. In all the 34 pediatric patients, 14 were treated with SPO, 12 were treated with PSO, and 8 were treated with VCR. All operations were performed by the senior author (L. X.) between 2005 and 2009 in the Institute of Spinal Deformity, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. Preoperative Halo-gravity traction was applied for 2 weeks in all patients; patients were evaluated by using standing radiographs taken before and after traction and after operation and a prospectively collected database with outcomes questionnaires. The postoperative complications and its relationship to preoperative assessment were also analyzed in this study. All the 34 patients' severe pediatric spinal deformity (22 females and 12 males) was diagnosed, with an average age of 11.97 years (range, 6-17 yr) and an average follow-up of 66.38 months (range, 48-97 mo). The mean preoperative major curve for each group was 103.43º in the SPO group, 108.08º in the PSO group, and 117.00º in the VCR group, and was corrected to 15.21º, 16.83º, and 25.88º, respectively. The apical vertebral translation was corrected by 73.29% by SPO, 73.35% by PSO, and 59.71% by VCR. The coronal balance was improved from 16.57 mm to 1.50 mm in the SPO group, 17.33 mm to 3.83 mm in the PSO group, and 29.38 mm to 3.63 mm in the VCR group. The mean correction of the kyphotic angle for single SPO was 19.00º, for those with 2 and 3 SPOs, the average correction was 34.40º and 47.5º, and 33.83º for the PSO group, 47.38º for the VCR group. There were significant improvements in the overall clinical outcomes. The overall complication rate was 35.3%. The complication rate was high in patients with respiratory insufficiency and rigid spine. There was no significant difference in coronal correction among these 3 techniques, whereas, the average corrections in the sagittal plane were progressively higher from single SPO to 2 SPOs or PSO to 3 SPOs or VCR. Preoperative respiratory insufficiency and rigidity of the spinal deformity are associated with a high complication rate. 3.\\n\", 'Recent studies implicate the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in septopreoptic (SPO) mechanisms that suppress preovulatory pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion during neuroglucopenia. Since Fos immunolabeling of the SPO of rats treated by caudal fourth ventricular (CV4) administration of the glucose antimetabolite, 5-thioglucose (5TG), parallels the distribution of GABA neuronal perikarya, the current studies investigated the genomic responsiveness of neuroanatomically-defined populations of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-immunoreactive (-ir) neurons in this region of the brain to hindbrain glucoprivation. In lieu of reports that CV4 5TG enhances SPO GABA turnover via mu opioid receptor (mu-R)-dependent mechanisms and evidence that GAD- and mu-R-ir are codistributed within the SPO, patterns of cellular colocalization of these antigens were also evaluated here. Neural tissue was obtained from groups of steroid-primed ovariectomized female rats 2 h after CV4 injection of vehicle or 5TG. Neuronal cell bodies in the lateral and medial septum, medial (MPN) and median preoptic nuclei (MEPO), and rostral medial preoptic area (rMPO) were immunostained for cytoplasmic GAD-ir, but only GAD-reactive neurons in the rMPO and MEPO exhibited robust nuclear colabeling for Fos in response to 5TG. SPO GABA neurons in the vehicle-treated controls were uniformly Fos-ir-negative. Dual immunolabeling for GAD- and mu-R revealed approximately 52% and 36% colabeling of this phenotype in the MEPO and MPN, and colocalization of lesser magnitude (18%) in the rMPO. These results demonstrate site-specific genomic activation of GABAergic neurons in the female rat SPO by CV4 glucose antimetabolite administration, and implicate MEPO and rMPO GABA cell populations in neural pathways that mediate regulatory effects of hindbrain glucoprivic signaling on CNS functions, including inhibition of the steroid positive feedback-activated gonadotropin-releasing hormone/LH neuroendocrine axis. The current studies also support the view that a proportion of neuroglucoprivic-sensitive GABA neurons in the MEPO and rMPO may be direct substrates for mu-R ligand modulatory actions during this state of central substrate imbalance.\\n', 'The Halloween gene SPOOK (SPO) is involved in the production of the active metabolite of ecdysteroid, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), in insects. A previous study showed that RNAi-mediated knockdown of SPO in Schistocerca gregaria last instar nymphs markedly reduced the hemolymph 20E titer, but did not affect metamorphosis. In the present study, the effects of SPO interference on development were re-examined in this locust. Injections of SPO double-stranded RNA (dsSPO) into nymphs at mid and late instars significantly delayed nymphal development and interfered with molting. The 20E levels of dsSPO-treated nymphs were generally low, with a delayed, small peak, suggesting that disturbance of the 20E levels caused the above developmental abnormalities. A small proportion of the dsSPO-injected nymphs metamorphosed precociously, producing adults and adultoids. Precocious adults were characterized by small body size, short wings with abbreviated venation, and normal reproductive activity. Fourth instar nymphs that precociously metamorphosed at the following instar exhibited temporal expression patterns of ecdysone-induced protein 93F and the juvenile hormone (JH) early-inducible gene Krüppel homolog 1 similar to those observed at the last instar in normal nymphs. Adultoids displayed mating behavior and adultoid females developed eggs, but never laid eggs. JH injection around the expected time of the 20E peak in the dsSPO-injected nymphs completely inhibited the appearance of adultoids, suggesting that appearance of adultoids might be due to a reduced titer of JH rather than of 20E. These results suggest that SPO plays an important role in controlling morphogenesis, metamorphosis, and reproduction in S. gregaria.\\n', 'The most common method used for minimizing the occurrence of diabetes complications is frequent glucose testing to adjust the insulin dose. However, using blood glucose (BG) meters presents a risk of infection. It is of great importance to develop non-invasive BG detection techniques. To realize high-accuracy, low-cost and continuous glucose monitoring, we have developed a non-invasive BG detection system using a mixed signal processor 430 (MSP430) microcontroller. This method is based on the combination of the conservation-of-energy method with a sensor integration module, which collects physiological parameters, such as the blood oxygen saturation (SPO 2 ), blood flow velocity and heart rate. New methods to detect the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and BV are proposed, which combine the human body heat balance and characteristic signals of photoplethysmography as well dual elastic chambers theory. Four hundred clinical trials on real-time non-invasive BG monitoring under suitable experiment conditions were performed on different individuals, including diabetic patients, senior citizens and healthy adults. A multisensory information fusion model was applied to process these samples. The algorithm (we defined it as DCBPN algorithm) applied in the model combines a decision tree and back propagation neural network, which classifies the physiological and environmental parameters into three categories, and then establishes a corresponding prediction model for the three categories. The DCBPN algorithm provides an accuracy of 88.53% in predicting the BG of new samples. Thus, this system demonstrates a great potential to reliably detect BG values in a non-invasive setting.\\n', 'Thiophosphate (SPO(3)) was recently shown to promote cysteine insertion at Sec (selenocysteine)-encoding UGA codons during selenoprotein synthesis. We reported previously that irreversible targeting by cDDP [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) or cisplatin] of the Sec residue in TrxR1 (thioredoxin reductase 1) contributes to cDDP cytotoxicity. This effect could possibly be attenuated in cells expressing less reactive Sec-to-cysteine-substituted TrxR1 variants, or pronounced in cells with higher levels of Sec-containing TrxR1. To test this, we supplemented cells with either SPO(3) or selenium and subsequently determined total as well as specific activities of cellular TrxR1, together with extent of drug-induced cell death. We found that cDDP became less cytotoxic after incubation of A549 or HCT116 cells with lower SPO(3) concentrations (100-300 μM), whereas higher SPO(3) (>300 μM) had pronounced direct cytotoxicity. NIH 3T3 cells showed low basal TrxR1 activity and high susceptibility to SPO(3) cytotoxicity, or to glutathione depletion. Supplementing NIH 3T3 cells with selenite, however, gave increased cellular TrxR1 activity with concomitantly decreased dependence on glutathione, whereas the susceptibility to cDDP increased. The results suggest molecular mechanisms by which the selenium status of cells can affect their glutathione dependence while modulating the cytotoxicity of drugs that target TrxR1.\\n', 'The role of organoselenium compounds as potent cancer chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents has been supported by epidemiological, preclinical and clinical studies. In this study, a novel selenadiazole derivative, 1,2,5-selenadiazolo-[3,4-d]pyrimidine-5,7-(4H,6H)-dione (SPO), is identified as a potent antiproliferative agent against human breast adrenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells, human hepatoma HepG2 cells and human melanoma A375 cells. Induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 and A375 cells by SPO was evidenced by accumulation of sub-G1 cell population, DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation. Further investigation on intracellular mechanisms found that SPO treatments induced activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9, overproduction of reactive oxygen species, and depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi m) through regulating the expression of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Our findings suggest that SPO is a promising novel organoselenium compound with potential in the treatment of human cancers.\\n', 'GnRH has been suggested to participate in corpus luteum function. Here we studied the expression of GnRH mRNA and peptide in two models of rat luteinized tissues: ovarian cells from PMSG-hCG treated prepubertal rats (SPO) and from intrasplenic ovarian tumors (Luteoma). A GnRH autoregulatory effect was evaluated as well as its action on cell proliferation and apoptosis. GnRH mRNA was present in SPO, isolated corpora lutea from SPO and Luteoma from 1 week to 7 months of development. In vitro cultures of Luteoma cells expressed 2-fold higher GnRH mRNA and 10-fold higher GnRH peptide than SPO cells. Buserelin (GnRH analog) increased GnRH mRNA and peptide expression in SPO but not in Luteoma cells. While basal proliferation was very low in Luteoma cells, SPO cells showed a significant increase in cell number by both the thymidine and the MTS methods after 72 h in culture. Buserelin induced a decrease in cell number in both cell types to a similar degree. Although basal apoptosis levels were higher in SPO than in Luteoma cells, Buserelin-induced apoptosis was only detected in Luteoma cells after 48 h treatment. These results show that the two types of rat, luteinized tissues, Luteoma and SPO, markedly differed in some intrinsic properties and in their local GnRH systems. Luteoma cells proliferate very weakly, express and secrete high amounts of GnRH, do not show an autoregulatory effect and respond to the decapeptide with apoptosis stimulation. In contrast SPO cells proliferate significantly, secrete low levels of GnRH but possess a positive, autoregulatory mechanism and respond to GnRH stimulation with impairment of proliferation.\\n', 'Effects of the salivary peroxidase (SPO) system on the growth, glucose uptake and metabolic activities of oral bacteria are well documented but the effects on oral fungi are virtually unknown. Therefore, the viability of Candida albicans (ATCC 28366) exposed to the peroxidase/SCN-/H2O2 system was studied in sterilized saliva, in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and in potassium chloride. The growth of C. albicans in glucose-supplemented saliva was faster at pH 5.5 than at pH 7. The addition of the complete SPO (or lactoperoxidase) system to either sterilized saliva, KCl (50 microM) or PBS at pH 5.5 inhibited dose-dependently the viability of C. albicans in KCl, but no inhibition was found in PBS or saliva. Maximal inhibition was achieved in 2 h and with > 320 microM of peroxidase-generated HOSCN/OSCN-. However, physiological salivary concentrations of phosphate (> or = 1.0 mM) and PBS blocked the antifungal effect of HOSCN/OSCN-. The relative proportions of SCN- and H2O2 were critical to the antifungal effects. With 0.2 mM KSCN, a complete loss of viability was achieved, though the HOSCN/OSCN- concentrations did not exceed 100 microM. It is concluded that C. albicans is sensitive to HOSCN/OSCN- but salivary concentrations of phosphate block the antifungal effect of the peroxidase systems.\\n', \"The Structured Preschool Participation Observation (SPO) for Children with ASD: Adaptation, Initial Psychometric Properties, and Children's Participation.\\nAims:  Due to the lack of tools evaluating participation of children with ASD in the educational setting, this study aimed to adapt the Structured Preschool Participation Observation (SPO), which assess the participation of preschool children attending mainstream-educational settings to children with ASD attending non-inclusive special education (content validity), to measure its initial psychometric properties (internal reliability, inter-rater reliability), and to describe children's participation characteristics, creating an effective tool to fill this gap. Methods:  Content validity was evaluated by 21 experts using questionnaires. Thirty-five children with ASD were observed in their educational setting using the adapted tool (SPO-ASD). Results:  Content validity was satisfactory regarding the items and their classification into occupational areas. Moderate to excellent internal consistency (α = .73-.92) and inter-rater reliability (ICC = .61-.95,  p <.05) were found for all scales and most areas. Children's participation frequency was high in learning and activities of daily living (ADL), low in play and social participation. Performance level was low in social participation. Enjoyment level was low, and needed assistance in ADL was high. Conclusions:  Based on our initial evaluation, the SPO-ASD may be suitable for assessing participation of children with ASD attending special education preschools. Additional studies are needed to more securely establish its psychometric properties.\\n\"])"
