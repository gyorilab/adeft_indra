       "['Chlorophyllin, the sodium and copper salt of chlorophyll, chlorophyll a, and chlorophyll b were tested for their ability to inhibit the mutagenic activity of the direct-acting mutagen 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NOP) and its plant-activated mutagenic enhancement. All three forms of chlorophyll were antimutagenic against both NOP and its plant-activated product, with chlorophyllin proving most effective. Chlorophyll-containing plant extracts, however, proved very efficient at activating NOP into a mutagen of greater potency. When these extracts were assayed for total chlorophyll content it was found that they contained far less chlorophyll than was required for an antimutagenic effect to occur. Thus, the balance between chemical mutagen activation and/or enhancement by chlorophyll-containing plant extracts and the potential antimutagenicity of these plant extracts is a function of chlorophyll concentration. The data presented here indicate that this balance must be taken into consideration in future studies investigating the efficacy of complex natural plant extracts as antimutagenic substances.\\n',\n",
       " 'The direct-acting mutagen 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NOP) was activated in vitro by pea or tobacco S-9 into a more potent mutagen in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98. NOP mutagenicity was not altered by Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver S-9. The plant S-9 activation of NOP was heat-sensitive but was not NADPH-dependent, did not involve superoxide radicals, and was not inhibited by CO. A direct relationship between plant peroxidase and NOP activation was established. Several purified peroxidases including horseradish peroxidase, chloroperoxidase, and lactoperoxidase also activated NOP. The perodoxidative process was not H2O2-dependent but was partially inhibited by a peroxidase inhibitor.\\n',\n",
       " 'Studies on plant metabolic activation with the S2 fraction from Zea mays have been developed. The 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NOP) activation by S2 has been analyzed with the Ames test as a short-term assay. The NOP mutagenic potency was increased two-fold by S2, while rat liver S9 produced the contrary effect. The presence of a NADPH-generating system and the treatment of S2 with CO do not modify S2 activation of NOP. In this fraction, neither cytochrome P450 nor some enzymatic activities depending on cyt-P450 (aniline hydroxylase and aminopyrine demethylase) were detected. Therefore, the enhancement of NOP mutagenic potency by S2 is independent of the mixed-function oxidase system. On the other hand, inhibitors of the peroxidase activity such as N-acetyl-p-aminophenol caused a partial inhibition of S2 activation of NOP. Likewise, diethyldithiocarbamate produced both a reduction of the S2 peroxidase activity in biochemical assays and a partial inhibition of S2 activation of NOP. Moreover, it was possible to find a direct correlation between the activity of peroxidase per plate of both the S2 fraction and horseradish peroxidase and the number of revertants induced by NOP in the TA98 strain. On the basis of these results, we report that a HRP-like peroxidase activity must be the main pathway of NOP activation by the plant metabolic activation system studied in this work.\\n',\n",
       " 'Aromatic amines are activated into mutagens by both animal and plant systems. For plant-activated aromatic amines an important step in this process involves peroxidase enzymes. 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NOP) is a well known direct-acting mutagen that can be enhanced in mutagenic potency by intact plant cells and also by isolated peroxidase enzymes. This activation process is inhibited by several different chemical agents including potassium cyanide (KCn), a known peroxidase inhibitor, and (+)-catechin. In our laboratory both KCn and (+)-catechin inhibited peroxidase-mediated NOP activation into a Salmonella mutagen. However, while KCn demonstrated strong peroxidase enzyme inhibition (as measured biochemically), (+)-catechin showed only minimal inhibition of peroxidase. Experiments comparing NOP direct and plant-activated mutagenic activity to different Salmonella strains (in the presence and absence of (+)-catechin) suggest that (+)-catechin may inhibit the mutagenic process by limiting O-acetyltransferase (OAT) activity in Salmonella. OAT activity in Salmonella is a required process for mutations to be induced following treatment with NOP and other aromatic amines.\\n',\n",
       " \"Accumulating evidence suggests the involvement of chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) hybrid chains in the brain's development and critical roles for oversulfated disaccharides and IdoUA residues in the growth factor-binding and neuritogenic activities of these chains. In the pursuit of sources of CS/DS with unique structures, neuritogenic activity, and therapeutic potential, two novel CS/DS preparations were isolated from shark liver by anion exchange chromatography. The major (80%) low sulfated and minor (20%) highly sulfated fractions had an average molecular mass of 3.8-38.9 and 75.7 kDa, respectively. Digestion with various chondroitinases (CSases) revealed a large panel of disaccharides with either GlcUA or IdoUA scattered along the polysaccharide chains in both of the fractions. The higher M(r) fraction, richer in IdoUA(2-O-sulfate)alpha1-3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate) and GlcUAbeta/IdoUAalpha1-3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) units, exerted greater neurite outgrowth-promoting (NOP) activity and better promoted the binding of various heparin-binding growth factors, including pleiotrophin (PTN), midkine, recombinant human heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, VEGF(165), fibroblast growth factor-2, fibroblast growth factor-7, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). These activities were largely abolished by digestion with CSase ABC or B but only moderately affected by a mixture of CSases AC-I and AC-II. In addition, the NOP activity of the larger fraction was markedly reduced by desulfation with alkali, suggesting a role for the 2-O-sulfate of IdoUA(2-O-sulfate)alpha1-3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate). The NOP activity of the higher molecular weight fraction and that of the embryonic pig brain-derived CS/DS fraction were also sup pressed to a large extent by antibodies against HGF, PTN, and their individual receptors cMet and anaplastic lymphoma kinase, revealing the involvement of the HGF and PTN signaling pathways in the activity.\\n\",\n",
       " 'In this study, we sought to determine whether and how endothelial scraping induces NO production (NOP) in the endothelium of excised rat aorta by exploiting the NO-sensitive fluorochrome, DAF-FM diacetate and the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye, Fura-2/AM.\\nWe demonstrated that injury-induced NOP at the lesion site is prevented in presence of the endothelial NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME, and in absence of extracellular Ca2+. Unlike ATP-dependent NO liberation, the NO response to injury is insensitive to BTP-2, which selectively blocks store-operated Ca2+ inflow. However, injury-induced NOP is significantly reduced by classic gap junction blockers, and by connexin mimetic peptides specifically targeting Cx37Hcs, Cx40HCs, and Cx43Hcs. Moreover, disruption of caveolar integrity prevents injury-elicited NO signaling, but not the accompanying Ca2+ response.\\nIn the present investigation, we sought to determine whether NO synthesis occurs in ECs facing the injury site of excised rat aorta. We further aimed at elucidating the signal transduction pathway responsible for NO release by lesioned endothelium. These goals were accomplished by loading ECs with Fura-2/AM, a Ca2+-sensitive fluorochrome, and DAF-FM diacetate, a NO-sensitive fluorescent dye. We provided, for the first time, the evidence that mechanical injury induces a long lasting NO production (NOP) in cells nearby the lesion site which requires Ca2+ entry through uncoupled Cx37Hcs, Cx40Hcs, and Cx43Hc. These results might aid in developing novel pharmacological treatments devoted to restore endothelial integrity upon invasive medical interventions.\\nNO production in ECs in intact rat aorta was monitored with the membrane permeant 4-Amino-5-methylamino-2\\',7\\'-difluorofluorescein (DAF-FM) diacetate. Once open, the aortic ring was fixed by small pins with the luminal side facing up, loaded with 10 µM DAF-FM for 60 min at room temperature and washed in PSS for one hour. DAF-FM fluorescence was measured by using the same equipment described for Ca2+ recordings but with a different filter set, i.e. excitation at 480 nm and emission at 535 nm wavelength (emission intensity was shortly termed \"NOi\"). NO measurements were performed and plotted on-line every 5 s. Again, off-line analysis was performed by using custom-made macros developed by Microsoft Office Excel software. The experiments were performed at room temperature. DAF-FM is essentially non-fluorescent until it irreversibly reacts with the nitrosonium cation produced by spontaneous oxidation of newly synthesized NO. The resulting fluorescent compound is trapped in the cytoplasm, so that DAF-FM fluorescence summates with continual NO production. As also found in bovine aortic ECs [38], DAF-FM fluorescence in rat aortic ECs underwent a persistent and linear increase likely due to the basal NO synthesis [19]. Accordingly, the change in baseline fluorescence was dramatically reduced when aortic rings were pre-incubated with L-NAME (5 mM), which inhibits eNOS by competing with its natural substrate, L-arginine (data not shown), or in 0Ca (data not shown). This observation was somehow expected since aortic endothelium has long been known to regulate vascular tone by basal release of NO [19]. Therefore, for each experiment, the basal DAF-FM signal was recorded for at least 20 minutes and the resulting curve fitted off-line by a linear regression equation in order to calculate the slope (i.e. the rate) of basal fluorescence increase. The slope was subtracted from the recorded trace, thus enabling to measure S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP)-, ATP- and injury-induced NOP independently on basal eNOS activity [39] (see below). NO synthesis was evaluated by subtracting the baseline level (1 min before the increase in DAF-FM fluorescence) to the average value of the plateau phase (1 min before the end of the recording) recorded upon either ATP administration or endothelial scraping.\\nInjury-induced NOP depends on extracellular Ca2+ entry\\nIt has long been known that, in vascular endothelium, eNOS is selectively activated by Ca2+ inflow rather than intracellular Ca2+ release [8,22,40]. When mechanical damage was carried out in absence of extracellular Ca2+, a maneuver which abolished the prolonged decay-phase of the Ca2+ signal, the injury did not result in a detectable NOP (Figure 3A). The involvement of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was investigated with the aid of thapsigargin (2 μM), an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, which prevents Ca2+ re-uptake into the stores and leads to their depletion. Preliminary experiments showed that pre-incubating the rings for 30 min with 2 μM thapsigargin abolished the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization triggered by supramaximal concentrations of ATP (300 μM) (n = 79; data not shown). Therefore, such a treatment causes the depletion of the Ca2+ reservoir underlying the initial Ca2+ response to injury [27]. The NO signal induced by endothelial scraping, however, was not significantly affected by thapsigargin (Figure 3A). Overall, these results strongly suggest that injury-promoted NOP in surviving ECs is sustained by Ca2+ entry, while is insensitive to Ca2+ release from ER. SOCE represents the preferential route for extracellular Ca2+ to engage eNOS in ECs [8,22,40]. However, BTP-2 (20 μM), a widely employed blocker of store-dependent Ca2+ inflow [6,8], does not significantly affect injury-induced NO synthesis (Figure 3A). We subsequently focused on the response to ATP, which elicits a BTP-2-sensitive SOCE in rat aortic endothelium [27]. ATP-induced NO synthesis was strongly inhibited in 0 Ca2+ (Figure 3B) and in the presence BTP-2 (Figure 3B). Collectively, these data concur with our previous findings on injury-induced Ca2+ inflow and rule out a detectable role for SOCE in NO release by lesioned endothelium.\\nThe long-lasting decay phase of injury-induced Ca2+ elevation in rat aortic rings is dramatically diminished by gap junction blockers, such as octanol, palmitoleic acid and oleamide [26,27,44,45]. In agreement with the Ca2+ measurements [27], octanol (4 mM), oleamide (200 μM), and palmitoleic acid (50 μM) dramatically affected NO synthesis elicited by endothelial scraping (Figure 3C). In the light of our previous observations [27], these findings hint at a role for Ca2+ inflow through CxHcs in mediating NOP in injured endothelium. We assessed the specificity of gap junction blockers by measuring the Ca2+ response to ATP (20 μM) in the presence of octanol. At this dose, ATP evokes an InsP3-dependent Ca2+ release, which is subsequently buffered by the combined action of SERCA and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger [27,34,46]. As shown in Figure 4, pre-incubating rat aortic rings with 4 mM octanol for 20 min did not significantly affect either the magnitude of the [Ca2+]i elevation or the rate of its decay phase to the baseline. This result concurs with previous evidence about the efficacy of gap junction blockers as selective uncoupling drugs in rat aortic rings [47,48], and further support the role of CxHcs in mediating NO synthesis in injured endothelium.\\nRat aortic endothelium may express three Cx isoforms, namely Cx37, Cx40, and Cx43 [32,49], albeit a recent work reported the presence of Cx32 in various cultured human ECs [50]. The contribution of each Cx isotype to injury-evoked NO liberation was examined by exploiting Cx-mimetic peptides containing amino acid sequences corresponding to the Gap27 extracellular domain of Cx37 and Cx43 (37,43Gap27) and to the Gap27 extracellular domain of Cx40 (40Gap27). Although initially designed to impair gap junctional communication, the primary target of these compounds is provided by CxHcs. The extracellular-loop sequence that interacts with the peptides is freely available in the CxHc form [51], so that full blockade of the unpaired hemichannel requires a much shorter pre-incubation (minutes vs. hours or longer) and much lower doses (micromolar vs. millimolar range) than inhibition of gap junctional coupling [51]. These compounds have been found to selectively inhibit Cx-dependent signalling in a variety of cell types, including rat aortic ECs [49,52], when the genetic suppression of specific Cx isoforms is not feasible, such as in rat endothelium [33,45]. In addition, Cx-mimetic peptides do not present the drawbacks reported in Cx-deficient mice [53]. For instance, Cx40-/- mice manifest either higher [54] or lower [55] levels of Cx37 as well as a significant decrease in Cx43 expression [56]. This feature makes the interpretation of the physiological data collected from these animals difficult. Incubating the aortic rings for 1 hour with either 37,43Gap27 (300 μM) or 40Gap27 (300 μM) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced injury-evoked NOP (Figure 5A and Figure 5B). The statistical analysis of these experiments has been reported in Figure 5C and Figure 5D. NO signalling was unaffected by peptides corresponding to scrambled sequences in Gap27, indicating that the inhibition resulted from specific sequence recognition on the selected Cx isotypes (Figure 5C and Figure 5D). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Ca2+ entry driving eNOS activity and NO liberation at the wound edge is supported by Cx37Hcs, Cx40Hcs, and Cx43Hcs. As discussed elsewhere [57], eNOS activation requires a sub-plasmalemmal Ca2+ increase rather a bulk increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Such a localized Ca2+ event may not even be detected by conventional epifluorescence microscopy [58]. As a consequence, we went on in assessing whether Cx-mimetic peptides targeting Cx37, Cx40, and Cx43 were also able to reduce the long-lasting decay phase of the Ca2+ response to mechanical damage. Figures 6A to 6D depict that neither 37,43Gap27 (300 μM) nor 40Gap27 (300 μM) significantly reduce either the initial Ca2+ peak or the subsequent decay phase. Rather, both Cx-mimetic peptides increased the amplitude of the initial Ca2+ response (Figure 6A-6C). Consistently, acute application of both peptides during recovery of the Ca2+ signal towards the baseline did not decreased the [Ca2+]i (n = 31, 40Gap27; n = 52, 37,43Gap27) (not shown). The same results were found by extending the pre-incubation period with both 37,43Gap27 and 40Gap27 up to 2 hours (Figure 6B-6D) [49]. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that Cx37Hcs, Cx40Hcs, and Cx43Hcs mediate the sub-membranal Ca2+ elevation responsible for eNOS activation, but not the bulk increase in [Ca2+]i caused by mechanical damage in surviving ECs. As the pharmacological profile of the decay phase is consistent with a CxHc pathway [2,26,27], it is conceivable that one or more additional Cx isoforms are expressed in rat aortic endothelium.\\nConnexin-mimetic peptides affect injury-induced NO synthesis. 1 hour pre-incubation with either 37,43Gap27 (300 μM) (A) or 40Gap27 (300 μM) (B) dramatically attenuated the increase in intracellular NO levels provoked by endothelial lesion. For sake of clarity, the control curve has been depicted in each Panel. All the experiments depicted in this figure have been carried out on the same day on different rings isolated from the same animal. The control (PSS, closed circles) trace is the mean±SE of 9 cells, while the 37,43Gap27 (open circles in Panel A) and 40Gap27 traces (open circles in Panel B) are, respectively, the mean±SE of 5 and 7 cells.

See the text for drug concentrations\\nConnexin mimetic peptides do not impair injury-induced elevation in [Ca2+]i in rat aortic endothelium. A, 1 hour pre-incubation with either 37,43Gap27 (300 μM) (gray trace) or 40Gap27 (300 μM) (dark grey trace) did not reduce injury-elicited intracellular Ca2+ signals in native endothelium of rat aorta. B, 2 hour pre-incubation with both 37,43Gap27 (300 μM) and 40Gap27 (300 μM) (grey trace) did not impair the intracellular Ca2+ response to injury at wound edge of rat aortic endothelium. C and D, mean±SE of NOP elicited by injury following the designated treatments. The asterisk indicates a level of significant difference <0.05. The number of ECs analyzed in each condition is indicated above the bars.\\nNO production by a highly localized Ca2+ signal sneaking beneath the plasma membrane requires the spatial proximity between the Ca2+ source and eNOS [57,58]. Caveolae represent a signalling platform responsible for translating Ca2+ entry into specific signal transduction pathways [24,57]. MβCD is a cholesterol-binding agent which has been widely employed to disrupt caveolar integrity in a variety of cell types, including ECs [24]. We first probed MβCD (10 mM) efficacy in impairing caveolae-dependent signalling by testing its effect on SOCE. As shown elsewhere [27,35], SOCE sustains the Ca2+ response to high concentrations of ATP (300 μM) in the endothelium of excised rat aorta. As shown in Figure 7A, MβCD significantly reduced the amplitudes of both the initial Ca2+ peak and the subsequent plateau, which are both supported by SOCE [27]. Consistently, MβCD inhibited ATP-dependent NOP in 85 out of 85 cells, whereas 93 out of 93 untreated cells liberated NO when exposed to ATP (Figure 7B). Then, to assess the role of caveolae in coupling CxHcs-mediated Ca2+ inflow with eNOS activation, rat aortic rings were pre-incubated (30 min) in the presence of MβCD (10 mM). Exposition to MβCD did not significantly affect the Ca2+ response to injury (Figure 8A and Figure 8B), but prevented the downstream NO synthesis (Figure 8C and Figure 8D). Collectively, these data indicate that the proximity between CxHcs and eNOS is maintained by the caveolar signalling platform within the plasma membrane. This feature is consistent with the highly localized nature of the Ca2+ signal driving NO synthesis.\\nEffect of caveolar impairment on injury-induced signalling in the luminal face of rat aorta. Pre-treatment with 10 mM MβCD to disrupt caveolae does not significantly affect the Ca2+ response to endothelial damage (A), but fully abolishes the accompanying NOP (C). B, MβCD effect on both the peak and the plateau of the Ca2+ elevation. The traces are the mean±SE, respectively, of 5 (PSS, closed circles) and 4 (MβCD, open circles) cells from two aortic rings harvested from the same animal on the same day. D, MβCD effect on NOP amplitude measured at 20 min after the injury. For both B and D, the number of ECs analyzed in each condition is indicated above the bars.\\nEndothelial-derived NO drives a number of processes which protects the vessel wall by pro-atherosclerotic events and maintain vascular homeostasis. NO exerts both an anti-aggregating and anti-inflammatory action, promotes endothelial survival, proliferation and migration, and prevents the phenotypic remodeling of the underlying layer of SMCs [2,19,59]. The present investigation provides the first evidence that endothelial ablation similar to that induced in vivo by stent deployment causes a local increase in NO levels by activating the ECs immediately adjacent to the lesion site. We further elucidated the molecular machinery responsible for eNOS recruitment and showed that injury-induced NOP is triggered by Ca2+ entry though Cx37Hcs, Cx40Hcs, and Cx43Hcs. The coupling between Ca2+ inflow and eNOS activation might be provided by cholesterol enriched membrane microdomains, such as caveolae. These data shed novel light on the endothelial reaction to mechanical scraping and hint at the Ca2+ machinery as a novel target to restore endothelial integrity after reconstructive surgery and to treat vascular diseases [2,12].\\nThe procedure that we adopted for mechanical scraping mimics the partial denudation of the endothelial monolayer that has been described upon stent deployment in a number of pre-clinical models [41-43]. The extent of the lesion we inferred is smaller as compared to the degree of endothelial ablation observed after coronary stenting in humans in patients [60], albeit it is in the same range as that described in previous studies addressing the role of Ca2+ signals in the regeneration of wounded monolayers [2,12]. However, a focal region devoid of the EC covering is rapidly repaired by neighbouring ECs, which spread into the lesioned area and undergo mitosis [61]. Accordingly, the daily rate of EC replication is increased by 50% at these sites in the rat aorta [62]. Therefore, the approach we utilized to perform the endothelial injury is useful to: 1) get insights into the acute response to the arterial damage in terms of Ca2+ response and accompanying NO synthesis and 2) elucidate the molecular machinery driving the subsequent process of endothelial regeneration Three pieces of evidences suggest that injury-induced NO synthesis is mainly driven by Ca2+ influx. First, there is no detectable NOP when the endothelium is scraped in absence of extracellular Ca2+. Second, injury-elicited NOP is not significantly affected by depletion of the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin, although we cannot rule out the possibility that InsP3-sensitive NOP falls below the resolution of our fluorimetric system. Third, blockade of Ca2+ entry by classic gap junction blockers, but not by BTP-2, dampen NO synthesis. These observations are consistent with the Fura-2 data and strongly suggest that CxHcs, rather than SOCE, provide the Ca2+ source driving NO liberation in damaged endothelium. Rat aortic endothelium has been found to express three main Cx isoforms, namely Cx37, Cx40, and Cx43 [32,49]. In order to elucidate which of them underpins NO synthesis, we exploited the reported selectivity of Cx-mimetic peptides [33,45]. Both 37,43Gap27 and 40Gap27 significantly attenuated NOP triggered by Ca2+ entry at the lesion site. The following lines of evidence confirm the specificity of 37,43Gap27 and 40Gap27: 1) pre-treatment with scrambled peptides did not detectably alter injury-induced NO synthesis (present study); and 2) 37,43Gap27 and 40Gap27 do not alter endogenous expression of Cx40 and Cx43 in the smooth muscle cell line A7r5, as well as connexin trafficking and de novo formation of gap plaques in A7r5 cells expressing Cx43-GFP [49]. These data strongly suggest that injury-elicited NOP at the wound edge of the aortic surface is sustained by Ca2+ influx through Cx37Hcs, Cx40Hcs, and Cx43Hcs. These results are further supported by previous studies, which showed that Cx43-containing gap junctions mediate the spreading of pro-inflammatory Ca2+ waves in lung capillaries [36] and sustain ATP-promoted Ca2+ bursts in uterine artery ECs [63]. Consistent with the role served by CxHc as Ca2+ entry pathways in vascular endothelium, Cx37Hc and Cx43Hc were recently shown to maintain bradykinin-induced intracellular Ca2+ oscillations in rat brain endothelial cells [29], while Cx32Hc- and Cx43Hc-mediated Ca2+ inflow supports the spiking response to bradykinin in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells [30]. Similarly, Cx43Hcs has already been shown to mediate Ca2+ influx and activate Ca2+-dependent downstream targets in a variety of cell types other than endothelial cells [31,64].\\nThe subcellular analysis of the Ca2+ signal driving eNOS activation has shown that Ca2+ entry results in a highly localized Ca2+ microdomain which is restricted to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane [57,58]. Therefore, CxHcs and eNOS are likely to tightly interact in order for Ca2+ inflow to stimulate NOP in injured endothelium. This hypothesis is supported by a number of recent studies. First, eNOS physically interacts with both Cx37 and Cx40 in in situ ECs of mouse aorta [65]. Second, Cx43 colocalizes with eNOS in native ECs covering the lumen of mice thoracodorsal arteries [66]. Third, Cx37 coimmunoprecipitates with eNOS in a number of human primary ECs [67]. The physical coupling between CxHcs and eNOS might be provided by cholesterol enriched membrane domains, such as caveolae. Indeed, MβCD abrogated injury-triggered NOP without affecting the underpinning Ca2+ signal. This feature suggests that disruption of caveolae does not modify CxHs gating, but physically displaces eNOS from the local source of Ca2+ responsible for its engagement. Consistently, caveolin-1 regulates the correct trafficking and localization to the plasma membrane of several Cx isoforms, including Cx 37, 40, and 43 [66,68,69]. Moreover, the expression of Cx37, Cx40 and Cx43 is decreased in caveolin-1 knock out arteries as compared to wild-type mice [70]. On the other hand, eNOS is targeted to caveolae by cotranslational N-myristoylation and posttranslational palmitoylation and interacts with the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 [23]. It this, therefore, likely that caveolae maintain CxHcs in close proximity to eNOS and, perhaps, to other relevant signalling proteins, as recently suggested in [70]. Interestingly, while ineffective in regulating the Ca2+-mobilizing properties of CxHcs, caveolar integrity is key to SOCE recruitment in vascular ECs [57]. In line with these evidences, cholesterol depletion with MβCD prevents store-operated Ca2+ inflow and NOP triggered by ATP in native rat aortic endothelium.\\nThe changes in DAF-FM fluorescence measured from the endothelial layer could also reflect some NOP occurring within the underlying SMCs, which generate a Ca2+ wave in response to mechanical injury [48]. This Ca2+ signal might, in turn, activate SMC eNOS and contribute to the increase in DAF-FM fluorescence we recorded from ECs at the wound edge [77]. However, injury-induced Ca2+ waves in SMCs entirely depend on intracellular Ca2+ release, rather than Ca2+ influx [48]. As a consequence, the fact that all the protocols impairing injury-elicited Ca2+ inflow into ECs nearby the lesion site (i.e. removal of external Ca2+ and exposition to gap junction blockers) affected the accompanying increase in DAF-FM fluorescence strongly hint at the endothelial origin of the NO signal. Nevertheless, the possibility that NO synthesis also takes place within the tunica media of damaged rat aortic rings cannot be ruled out.\\n',\n",
       " 'Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common pediatric bacterial infection, and stringently defined otitis-prone (sOP) children have immunologic deficiencies. We recently found that nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) elicits a NP mucosal antibody response to vaccine candidate pneumococcal proteins that correlate with protection from AOM in non-sOP (NOP) children. Here, we sought to determine if sOP children experience significantly higher colonization rates with Spn than NOP children, develop lower naturally acquired NP mucosal antibody responses to those same pneumococcal proteins after colonization by Spn, and suffer greater frequency of AOM as a consequence. NP samples were collected from 130 NOP and 45 sOP children during 270 healthy visits and 201 AOM visits between 6 and 24 months of age. Spn were identified by standard culture. NP mucosal IgG and IgA levels to vaccine candidate proteins pneumococcal histidine triad protein D, pneumococcal choline binding protein A (PcpA) and pneumolysin D1 were measured by quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. sOP children had significantly higher colonization frequency by Spn (P < 0.0001) and significantly lower IgG and IgA levels to all 3 vaccine candidate proteins studied compared with NOP children (all P values <0.05) except IgG to Ply D1 (P = 0.31). Spn colonization in NOP children led to 2-fold to 5-fold increase in mucosal IgG and IgA levels to all 3 proteins (all P values <0.01), whereas Spn colonization in sOP children generally failed to elicit antibody responses (all P values >0.05). PcpA was unique in inducing significant increases in mucosal IgA (P = 0.02). When high mucosal IgG levels to all 3 proteins and IgA to PcpA were measured, they correlated with reduced AOM in sOP children. sOP children experience significantly higher colonization rates with Spn, develop lower naturally acquired NP mucosal antibody responses to pneumococcal vaccine candidate proteins pneumococcal histidine triad protein D, PcpA and pneumolysin D1 after colonization by Spn, and suffer greater frequency of AOM if they do not generate high mucosal antibody to the studied proteins.\\n',\n",
       " \"It remains unclear whether the efficacy of nonsurgical organ-preservation modalities (NOP) in the treatment of advanced-stage laryngeal cancer was noninferiority compared with that of total laryngectomy (TL). The objective of this study was to compare the curative effects between TL and NOP in the treatment of advanced-stage laryngeal cancer through a meta-analysis.\\nSixteen retrospective studies involving 8308 patients (4478 in the TL group and 3701 in the nonsurgical group) were included in this meta-analysis. The analysis results displayed the advantage of TL for 2-year and 5-year overall survival (OS)(OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.85–4.23 and OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.09–2.14) as well as in 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS)(OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.61–1.98), but no significant difference in 2-year DSS was detected between the 2 groups (OR\\u200a=\\u200a2.09,95% CI0.69–6.40). Additionally, there were no significant differences between TL and NOP for 5-year local control (LC) either (OR\\u200a=\\u200a1.75, 95% CI 0.87–3.53). When we carried out subgroup analyses, the advantage of TL was especially obvious in T4 subgroups, but not in T3 subgroups.\\nThis is the first study to compare the curative effects on advanced-stage laryngeal cancer using meta-analytic methodology. Although there was a trend in favor of TL for OS and DSS, there is no clear difference in oncologic outcome between TL and NOP. Therefore, other factors such as tumor T-stage and size, lymph node metastasis, and physical condition are also important indicators for treatment choice.\\nCancer of the larynx is among the most common cancers of the head and neck, with almost 110,000 to 130,000 new cases diagnosed worldwide annually.1,2 Most of these cancers are squamous cell carcinoma, accounting for 85% to 95% of laryngeal malignant neoplasms.3 The large majority of laryngeal cancer patients diagnosed are in early stage which has a highly cure rate, with 5-year locoregional control rate approaching 90%.4 However, the therapy effects of advanced laryngeal cancer (stage III or IV) is extremely poorer than that in early stages. Advanced stage of laryngeal cancer is associated with a higher rate of relapse and cancer-related death, having crucial influence on overall prognosis. Increasing patients have already been in advanced stages, especially in the IV phase, when they are diagnosed.5 There were 2 different treatment strategies for advanced laryngeal cancer, namely total laryngectomy (TL) and nonsurgical organ-preservation modalities (NOP). The implementation of the latter includes vital conservation surgeries such as partial vertical laryngectomy (extending hemilaryngectomy), near laryngectomy with epiglottic reconstruction and supracricoid partial laryngectomy (with cricohyo-idoepiglottopexy reconstruction), and big nonsurgical organ-preservation treatments such as chemoradiation (CRT) and radiotherapy (RT). However, TL followed by RT or other therapeutic strategy provided no significant improvement in survival time in the past 30 years.6 Until now, the constituent of optimal treatment modality for advanced stage larynx cancers still has been mightily debated in medical research. One of the most controversial questions is the choice between conventional TL and organ preservation with nonsurgical treatment when facing advanced-stage laryngeal cancer. TL for laryngeal carcinoma results in the loss of vocal function, which was a major disadvantage of this method. The target of larynx-preservation approaches is to preserve the functional organ; nevertheless we worry over the survival rate and time when using such treatments. Whether the survival rate and time of patients with advanced-stage larynx cancer treated with NOP are noninferiority compared with those who are treated with TL? Which therapeutic strategy is optimal? Neither do we know. Some researchers have made efforts to preserve the larynx with nonsurgical treatment regiments that can improve quality of patients’ life and retain physiological function of larynx without compromising survival. Other scholars, however, believe that many situations should be considered as the basis of treatment choice, such as tumor size, the status of tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis, patient's performance status, and so on. Consequently, multiple studies have compared the 2 treatments of advanced laryngeal cancer. The objective of this study was to compare the effects between TL and NOP in the treatment of advanced-stage laryngeal cancer via a meta-analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the 2 methods using meta-analytic methodology.\\nComparison of overall survival (2-year overall survival, A; 5-year overall survival, B) between total laryngectomy (TL) and nonsurgical organ-preservation modalities (NOP). CI\\u200a=\\u200aconfidence interval; NOP\\u200a=\\u200anonsurgical organ-preservation; OR\\u200a=\\u200aodds ratio; TL\\u200a=\\u200atotal laryngectomy.\\nIn addition, we found that patients treated with TL had improved 2-year LC compared with patients treated with nonsurgical treatment (OR\\u200a=\\u200a2.67, 95% CI 1.60–4.44, P\\u200a=\\u200a0.0002; Figure 5A). But there were no significant difference between TL and NOP for 5-year LC (OR\\u200a=\\u200a1.75, 95% CI 0.87–3.53, P\\u200a=\\u200a0.12; Figure 5B).\\nThe results of our meta-analysis manifested that comparing to nonsurgical modalities, TL might improve 2-year OS, 5-year OS, 5-year DSS, and 2-year LC, without statistically significant difference in 2-year DSS or 5-year LC. Therefore, we hypothesized that TL may be superior to nonsurgical modalities in improving long-term survival while may not possess a similar advantage for the local control rate. So, in the treatment of advanced-stage laryngeal cancer, TL cannot be indiscriminately considered superior to NOP modalities and vice verse. Then, what affect the survival outcomes of patients treated with nonsurgical treatment? For this question, the plausible explanations may lie in many aspects, such as multiple side-effect of treatments, as well as worse physical condition or other situations of the patients in the nonsurgical group. And this analysis was limited in terms of its small sample size, the difference method of RT and chemotherapy, diverse follow-up times, and various general situations of the patients. So we need more clinical trials to answer this question.\\n\",\n",
       " 'The effect of CS on neurite outgrowth-promoting (NOP) activity was examined, using E16 embryonic mouse hippocampal neurons, because M. chinensis CS contained significant amount of E-type units (Figure 1B). Thus, hippocampal neurons were cultured with clam CS (Fr. 4, see Figure 1B), and KS-branched polysaccharide (remaining polysaccharides, see Figure 2C), CS-E (a positive control) and CS-A (a negative control) that were each immobilized onto coverslips precoated with poly-d,l-ornithine. As a result, CS-E, clam CS (Fr. 4) and KS-branched polysaccharides stimulated neurite outgrowth, and their NOP activities were completely disappeared by the Chase ABC and ACII treatment (Figure 7).\\nCS plays an important role in enhancing or preventing the elongation of axons [5,6]. Recent studies have focused on the molecular mechanism by which CS PGs stimulate or prevent axonal elongation, and several receptors for CS have been identified at the neuronal cell surface. In the case of E16 embryonic mouse hippocampal neurons, there are several reports that NOP activities of highly sulfated CS are observed when highly sulfated CS is pre-coated [4,8,14,16,17]. Because the barrier effect of KS PG to neurite outgrowth was reported [32], the effect of clam CS, having KS disaccharide unit, was examined (Figure 7). However, NOP activities of KS-branched polysaccharides were moderately stimulated when compared with those of CS-E and clam CS (Fr. 4), and it was also observed that Chase ABC and ACII treatment diminished its NOP activities, suggesting the importance of consecutive E-type unit sequence but not the KS disaccharide unit in KS-branched polysaccharides. Experiments are in progress to identify the specific biological activities of M. chinensis CS.\\n',\n",
       " \"A decrease in methanogenesis is expected to improve ruminant performance by allocating rumen metabolic hydrogen ([2H]) to more energy-rendering fermentation pathways for the animal. However, decreases in methane (CH4) emissions of up to 30% are not always linked with greater performance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to understand the fate of [2H] when CH4 production in the rumen is inhibited by known methanogenesis inhibitors (nitrate, NIT; 3-nitrooxypropanol, NOP; anthraquinone, AQ) in comparison with a control treatment (CON) with the Rumen Simulation Technique (RUSITEC). Measurements started after 1 week adaptation. Substrate disappearance was not modified by methanogenesis inhibitors. Nitrate mostly seemed to decrease [2H] availability by acting as an electron acceptor competing with methanogenesis. As a consequence, NIT decreased CH4 production (−75%), dissolved dihydrogen (H2) concentration (−30%) and the percentages of reduced volatile fatty acids (butyrate, isobutyrate, valerate, isovalerate, caproate and heptanoate) except propionate, but increased acetate molar percentage, ethanol concentration and the efficiency of microbial nitrogen synthesis (+14%) without affecting gaseous H2. Nitrooxypropanol decreased methanogenesis (−75%) while increasing both gaseous and dissolved H2 concentrations (+81% and +24%, respectively). Moreover, NOP decreased acetate and isovalerate molar percentages and increased butyrate, valerate, caproate and heptanoate molar percentages as well as n-propanol and ammonium concentrations. Methanogenesis inhibition with AQ (−26%) was associated with higher gaseous H2 production (+70%) but lower dissolved H2 concentration (−76%), evidencing a lack of relationship between the two H2 forms. Anthraquinone increased ammonium concentration, caproate and heptanoate molar percentages but decreased acetate and isobutyrate molar percentages, total microbial nitrogen production and efficiency of microbial protein synthesis (−16%). Overall, NOP and AQ increased the amount of reduced volatile fatty acids, but part of [2H] spared from methanogenesis was lost as gaseous H2. Finally, [2H] recovery was similar among CON, NOP and AQ but was largely lower than 100%. Consequently, further studies are required to discover other so far unidentified [2H] sinks for a better understanding of the metabolic pathways involved in [2H] production and utilization.\\nThus, the objective of this experiment was to provide more detailed information on the fate of [2H] when methanogenesis is decreased in the rumen. To this end, various known chemical inhibitors assumed to have different modes of action on CH4 production (nitrate, NIT; 3-nitrooxypropanol, NOP; anthraquinone, AQ) were used. In the rumen, NIT decreases methanogenesis by competing for [2H] during dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (NH4+; DNRA) or during denitrification leading to nitrous oxide (N2O) production (Yang et al., 2016). At the same time, nitrite produced as an intermediary product of DNRA would have a direct toxic effect toward methanogenic Archaea (Klüber and Conrad, 1998; Asanuma et al., 2015). Nitrate decreased CH4 production in lactating dairy cows (21 g nitrate/kg dry matter [DM], −23.4% CH4; Olijhoek et al., 2016), steers (30 g nitrate/kg DM, −29.4% CH4; Newbold et al., 2014) and sheep (20 g nitrate/kg DM, −16.5% CH4; de Raphélis-Soissan et al., 2014). Nitrooxypropanol is a synthetic compound developed by DSM Nutritional Products Ltd (Kaiseraugst, Switzerland). By positioning itself into the active site of the methyl-coenzyme M reductase, NOP inactivates cofactor F430 thereby inhibiting the last step of CH4 production in methanogenic Archaea (Duin et al., 2016). It decreased methanogenesis in sheep (100 mg/d, −23.7% CH4; Martínez-Fernández et al., 2014), lactating dairy cows (2.5 g/d, −6.7% CH4; Reynolds et al., 2014) and beef heifers (2.0 g/d, −59.2% CH4; Romero-Perez et al., 2015). Anthraquinones are the largest group of quinones (Thomson, 1971) and are naturally present in a large number of plant-derived drugs (Mueller et al., 1999). Their mode of action as methanogenesis inhibitors in the rumen has not been clearly elucidated although they are known to have antibacterial activity (Odom, 1997) by disrupting bacterial membranes (Chan et al., 2011) and bacterial protein synthesis (Anke et al., 1980). In sheep, 9,10-anthraquinone supplementation caused a decrease in CH4 production and an accumulation of H2, suggesting a direct toxic effect toward methanogenic Archaea (500 ppm/d, −50% CH4; Kung et al., 2003).\\nThe experiment was conducted at the Lethbridge Research and Development Centre (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada). The Rumen Simulation Technique (RUSITEC) was favored over a batch culture or an in vivo experiment as it allows for a more precise control of the system while offering the possibility to evaluate the long-term effect of selected methanogenesis inhibitors. Two RUSITEC apparatuses were used, each one consisting of a water bath maintained at 39°C and 8 fermentation vessels of 900 mL working volume automatically and continuously vertically mixed. The experiment was designed as a randomized block with 4 treatments repeated in duplicate in each RUSITEC apparatus (n = 4). The treatments were control diet alone (CON; 60% corn silage and 40% cereals and minerals on a DM basis) or supplemented with NIT, NOP or AQ (Table 1). The average organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) content of the substrate was 91.1, 21.0, 37.8, and 18.7% of DM. The incubation lasted 19 days. The microbial community was adapted to treatments from day 1 to 7, and measurements started on day 8 until day 19. Supplementation of methanogenesis inhibitors was constant from day 1 to 14 and was then discontinued to study the recovery of fermentation after removal of the methanogenesis inhibitors.\\nIngredient and chemical composition of the substrates used in the in vitro rumen simulation technique; treatments were control (CON), nitrate (NIT), 3-nitrooxypropanol (NOP), and anthraquinone (AQ).\\nThe dose of each additive was selected with an aim of obtaining 80% CH4 decrease. Calcium ammonium nitrate was used as the NO3- source (5Ca(NO3)2·NH4NO3, 75% NO3- in product DM; Yara International, Oslo, Norway). Given that NO3- had never been tested in RUSITEC conditions, the dose was chosen based on a meta-analysis of in vivo experiments (Lee and Beauchemin, 2014) to be equal to 803 mg NO3- vessel−1 d−1 (8.0% NO3- in substrate DM), equivalent to 1.07 g calcium ammonium nitrate vessel−1 d−1. Urea and calcium carbonate were added in CON, NOP, and AQ to compensate for the additional non-protein nitrogen (NPN) and calcium provided with calcium ammonium nitrate in NIT.\\nDose of NOP (11.6% 1,3-propanediol mononitrate in product DM; DSM Nutritional Products Ltd., Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) was based on the RUSITEC study by Romero-Pérez et al. (2015) and was equal to 5 mg 1,3-propanediol mononitrate vessel−1 d−1, equivalent to 43.1 mg NOP vessel−1 d−1. The NOP carrier (a mixture of silica and propylene glycol) was added in equivalent amounts in CON, NIT, and AQ to compensate for any possible effects of the carrier on fermentation.\\nDose of 9,10-anthraquinone (97% anthraquinone in product DM; Sigma-Aldrich Corp., Saint Louis, MO) was selected based on the in vitro continuous culture incubation by Garcia-Lopez et al. (1996) to be equal to 12.3 mg 9,10-anthraquinone vessel−1 d−1. Because of poor solubility in water (Garcia-Lopez et al., 1996), AQ was dissolved in 70% (v/v) ethanol (12.3 g/L). One milliliter of this solution was added every day to AQ vessels, as well as 1 mL pure 70% (v/v) ethanol to CON, NIT, and NOP vessels to compensate for the addition of ethanol in AQ vessels.\\nCorn silage and barley grain were freeze-dried and ground in a Wiley mill (A.H. Thomas, Philadelphia, PA) through a 4-mm screen. Then, substrates were prepared by mixing all ingredients per treatment except for NOP active compound and carrier. Feed samples were then weighed (10 g) into nylon bags (51 μm mesh opening) sealed with heat and stored at room temperature until further use. The active compound and carrier of NOP were kept in the dark and at 4°C as recommended by the supplier, and were individually weighed daily before being added to the vessels during substrate bag exchange.\\nFinally, for treatments CON, NOP, and AQ, and for each scenario of caproate production, the [2H] balance (mmol/d) was calculated as the difference between [2H] produced (mmol/d) and [2H] consumed (mmol/d) and the percentage of [2H] recovered was calculated as the ratio between [2H] consumed (mmol/d) and [2H] produced (mmol/d).\\nNitrate tended to decrease daily total gas production (27% decrease relative to CON), whereas NOP and AQ had no effect (P = 0.083; Table 3). Overall total GHG produced was different among treatments (P < 0.001) with NIT and NOP producing less GHG compared to CON and AQ (−73%). Methane percentage was the lowest with NIT and NOP (75% decrease on average relative to CON), whereas AQ decreased CH4 by 26% relative to CON (P < 0.001). The percentage of gH2 was similar between CON and NIT, but was greater with NOP and AQ (5.2- and 3.3-fold increase relative to CON, respectively; P < 0.001). Carbon dioxide percentage was similar between CON and AQ, but was greater with NIT and NOP (1.18- and 1.05-fold increase relative to CON, respectively; P < 0.001). Nitrous oxide was only detected with NIT (0.04% of total gas; P = 0.011). Dissolved H2 concentration also differed among treatments, with the greatest concentration recorded for NOP, followed in descending order by CON, NIT and AQ (P < 0.001). Inhibiting methanogenesis did not affect DM and OM disappearance of the substrate, but NIT decreased CP disappearance (77.4 and 69.5% for CON and NIT respectively, P = 0.028; Table 3).\\nEffects of control (CON), nitrate (NIT), 3-nitrooxypropanol (NOP), and anthraquinone (AQ) on gas production and substrate disappearance using a rumen simulation technique.\\nMedium pH was similar among treatments and averaged 6.95 (Table 4). Total VFA concentration tended to differ among treatments (P = 0.098), with the lowest concentration for NIT (22.3% decrease relative to CON). Lactate and succinate were not detected for any treatment. Treatments did not modify formate, but tended to change propionate molar percentage (P = 0.061), numerically decreasing it with NIT and increasing it with NOP and AQ. Compared to CON, NIT increased acetate molar percentage (+16.0 percentage units) and decreased butyrate, isobutyrate, valerate, isovalerate, caproate and heptanoate molar percentages (−1.8, −0.26, −1.51, −6.77, −3.29, and −1.09 percentage units, respectively; P < 0.001). In contrast, NOP and AQ both decreased acetate molar percentage (−7.4 and −5.6 percentage units, respectively) and increased caproate (+2.24 and +4.78 percentage units, respectively) and heptanoate molar percentages (+0.74 and +1.58 percentage units, respectively) (P < 0.001). Nitrooxypropanol also increased butyrate and valerate (+2.10 and +2.70 percentage units, respectively), but decreased isovalerate (−1.58 percentage units) molar percentages (P < 0.001). Anthraquinone decreased isobutyrate (−0.09 percentage units; P < 0.001) without affecting butyrate, valerate and isovalerate molar percentages. Only NIT modified acetate:propionate (+2.2 ratio points relative to CON; P < 0.001) and (acetate+butyrate):propionate (+2.19 ratio points relative to CON; P = 0.002).\\nEffects of control (CON), nitrate (NIT), 3-nitrooxypropanol (NOP), and anthraquinone (AQ) on fermentation variables using a rumen simulation technique.\\nEthanol concentration increased with NIT (1.68-fold increase relative to CON; P < 0.001) but was not affected by NOP and AQ. No treatment other than NOP affected n-propanol concentration (2.16-fold increase relative to CON; P = 0.004). Ammonium concentration was greater for NOP and AQ (1.38-fold increase relative to CON on average) and lower for NIT (19.9% decrease relative to CON) (P < 0.001). Finally, nitrate and nitrite were detected in outflow from NIT, showing that a maximum of 94% of the daily amount of NO3- supplied could have been fully reduced to NH4+.\\nMicrobial N production was modified differently depending upon the treatment (Table 5; P < 0.05). Treatment NIT increased both total microbial N production and efficiency of microbial protein synthesis (1.17- and 1.16-fold increase relative to CON, respectively), whereas AQ decreased both variables (13.3 and 17.3% decrease relative to CON, respectively). Treatment NOP had no effect on either variable.\\nEffects of control (CON), nitrate (NIT), 3-nitrooxypropanol (NOP), and anthraquinone (AQ) on microbial protein synthesis using a rumen simulation technique.\\nRepresentation of treatments along components 1 and 2 and along components 1 and 3 is shown in Figures 2A,B. Treatment NIT created a distinct group along component 1 because of greater efficiency of microbial protein synthesis and N2O production and also because of lower gH2 production and branched-chain VFA. Treatment AQ was separated from other treatments in component 2 as it was characterized by high concentrations of caproate and heptanoate and low acetate concentration. Finally, NOP clustered along component 3 mostly because of high dH2 and propanol concentrations, but also because of numerically higher formate concentration.\\nScore plots obtained by principal component analysis describing the distribution of treatments (control, CON; nitrate, NIT; 3-nitrooxypropanol, NOP; anthraquinone, AQ) tested with a rumen simulation technique along components 1 and 2 (A) and components 1 and 3 (B).\\nTotal [2H] production was not different among treatments, regardless of caproate metabolic pathway used (Table 7). However, NIT decreased the amount of [2H] produced from butyrate (30.4% decrease relative to CON; P = 0.036), and NOP tended to decrease [2H] production from acetate (21.8% decrease relative to CON; P = 0.053). In SC2, AQ and NIT respectively produced the greatest and the lowest amount of [2H] from caproate (P < 0.001) compared to the other treatments.\\nEffects of control (CON), nitrate (NIT), 3-nitrooxypropanol (NOP), and anthraquinone (AQ) on metabolic hydrogen ([2H]) balance using a rumen simulation technique.\\nTreatments modified all pathways of [2H] consumption except propionate (Table 7). Nitrate decreased [2H] uptake into formate and valerate (29.2 and 41.7% decrease relative to CON, respectively; P = 0.001) whereas NOP increased [2H] diverted toward valerate (1.36-fold increase relative to CON). In SC1, [2H] uptake into caproate was greater with AQ, followed by NOP, CON, and NIT (P < 0.001). Both NOP and AQ increased [2H] directed toward heptanoate (0.37- and 1.93-fold increase relative to CON, respectively) whereas NIT decreased [2H] consumption in heptanoate formation (76.7% decrease relative to CON; P < 0.001). The amount of [2H] used for methanogenesis was lower for NIT and NOP (86% decrease on average relative to CON; P < 0.001) and was not modified with AQ. Nitrate did not modify the amount of [2H] incorporated into gH2, but NOP and AQ increased it (3.47-fold increase on average relative to CON; P < 0.001). Finally, in SC1, NOP presented similar rates of total [2H] consumption as did CON whereas AQ increased total [2H] uptake (1.31-fold increase relative to CON; P < 0.001). In SC2, total [2H] consumption was similar among CON, NOP and AQ.\\nOverall, treatments modified [2H] balance differently (P < 0.001; Table 7). Expressed as daily millimoles, the [2H] balance in SC1 was similar between NOP and AQ but lower than CON (34.9% decrease on average relative to CON; P = 0.016). In SC2, the [2H] balance of NOP was also lower than CON (16.4% decrease relative to CON; P = 0.034). Total [2H] consumed expressed as a proportion of total [2H] produced was similar between CON, NOP and AQ in SC2, but was greater for NOP and AQ in SC1 (1.36-fold increase on average relative to CON; P = 0.004).\\nWithin treatments, data comparison between measurement and recovery periods presented some differences, most probably because of the microbial evolution of the system throughout time and discontinuation of the treatments. Therefore, data between the two experimental periods were not compared, but comparisons among treatments within each period can still be considered. After removal of methanogenesis inhibitors, total gas production and composition (day 17–19) were similar among treatments, except for gH2 percentage which remained higher with AQ (2.74-fold increase relative to CON, P = 0.028; Table 8). Dissolved H2 still differed among previous treatments (P = 0.019) with a lower concentration for AQ (43% decrease relative to CON). However, dH2 concentrations for AQ recovered to values similar to those of CON on the last day of measurement (day 18; Figure 3). Substrate degradation was only affected by NOP, with lower DM (P = 0.025) and OM (P = 0.018) disappearance and a tendency (P = 0.104) for lower CP disappearance (6.3, 6.7, and 4.0 percentage units decrease relative to CON, respectively).\\nEffects of control (CON), nitrate (NIT), 3-nitrooxypropanol (NOP), and anthraquinone (AQ) on gas production and substrate disappearance after treatment withdrawal (recovery period; day 14–19) using a rumen simulation technique.\\nEffects of control (CON), nitrate (NIT), 3-nitrooxypropanol (NOP), and anthraquinone (AQ) on dissolved H2 concentration after 1 (day 15), 2 (day 16), 3 (day 17), and 4 (day 18) days of treatment withdrawal (recovery period; day 14–19) using a rumen simulation technique.\\nTotal VFA concentration and pH were similar among previous treatments but individual VFA molar percentages were still different during recovery (Table 9). Compared to CON, NOP and AQ decreased acetate molar percentage (−3.7 and −3.8 percentage units, respectively; P = 0.001), AQ decreased propionate molar percentage (−1.3 percentage units; P = 0.039) and NIT increased butyrate molar percentage (+2.7 percentage units; P = 0.023). Except for isobutyrate, minor VFA molar percentages were also different among treatments. Compared to CON, valerate molar percentage was greater with NIT and NOP (+1.35 and +1.56 percentage units, respectively; P = 0.005), isovalerate molar percentage was lower with NIT (−5.85 percentage units; P < 0.001) and caproate and heptanoate molar percentages were greater with AQ (+2.78 and +0.92 percentage units, respectively; P < 0.001). Volatile fatty acid ratios were not modified by treatments (4.01 and 5.18 on average for acetate:propionate and (acetate+butyrate):propionate ratio), as well as ethanol and n-propanol concentrations. Finally, NH4+ concentrations were similar among NIT, NOP, and AQ, but lower for all treatments compared to CON (18% decrease on average; P = 0.040).\\nEffects of control (CON), nitrate (NIT), 3-nitrooxypropanol (NOP), and anthraquinone (AQ) on fermentation variables after treatment withdrawal (recovery period; day 14–19) using a rumen simulation technique.\\nNitrooxypropanol is a hydrosoluble compound quickly degradable (Duin et al., 2016). As a consequence, its effects on rumen fermentation probably take place in a limited period of time. However, this property did not prevent NOP from decreasing methanogenesis by 80%, which agrees with similar CH4-mitigating efficiency observed in a previous RUSITEC study by Romero-Pérez et al. (2015) (76% CH4 reduction with 5 mg 1,3-propanediol mononitrate vessel−1 d−1). The lower CH4 production with NOP was associated with an increase of gH2 and dH2, showing that [2H] spared from decreased methanogenesis was not fully re-allocated toward other fermentation pathways. However, given that NOP decreased CH4 production by 1.05 mmoles and that 1 mole CH4 is produced from 4 moles [2H], availability of [2H] increased by 4.21 mmoles. As NOP increased gH2 by 0.38 mmoles, it means that 9% of reducing equivalents not used in CH4 formation ended up in accumulated H2. This percentage is close to a previous meta-analysis estimate (5.8%) based on 100% methanogenesis inhibition in continuous culture (Ungerfeld, 2015).\\nPropanol concentration increased during the treatment period, most probably as a result of NOP degradation. Indeed, one mole of NOP is degraded to one mole of propanol through propanediol and propanal (Duin et al., 2016). The calculated moles of additional propanol with NOP (0.14 mmoles/d increase relative to CON) largely exceeded the daily molar supplementation of NOP (0.04 mmoles/d). Assuming that the full amount of NOP was degraded to propanol and that the dilution rate of propanol was similar to the aqueous phase, calculations showed that the greater propanol concentration was likely related to its accumulation over days (data not shown).\\nNo additional [2H] was directed toward microbial protein synthesis, as microbial efficiency was similar to that of CON, confirming the results of Romero-Pérez et al. (2015). Overall, the [2H] balance was similar between CON and NOP. Depending on the caproate production scenario assumed, between 46 and 72% of [2H] produced was still not accounted for in the balance, indicating that several [2H] sinks were missed in the current experiment.\\nUpon removal of the NOP treatment, gas production and composition, as well as propanol concentration, recovered to control levels even though acetate molar percentage did not fully recover and remained lower than CON. Similarly, valerate molar percentage was still greater than CON during recovery. These few remaining differences between CON and NOP may indicate changes of microbiota during the NOP treatment period, that require more than 5 days to fully recover.\\nDespite the lower percentage of CH4 decrease in comparison to NIT and NOP, AQ had a persistent effect on fermentation as dH2 concentration remained lower than CON during the recovery period. Moreover, CH4 production was still numerically lower in AQ compared to CON after treatment removal. This outcome may be the consequence of a strong negative effect of AQ on microbiota, which may have had difficulties recovering after withdrawal. Indeed, this plant extract is known to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by blocking the first step of RNA translation to protein in the ribosomal A site (Anke et al., 1980). Decreased bacterial activity may also account for the observed decrease in microbial protein synthesis and greater concentration of NH4+ during the treatment period. However, similarly to NOP, the lower NH4+ concentration observed with AQ during the recovery period compared with CON could be an indication of resumption of microbial activity due to greater NH4+ incorporation into microbial amino acids.\\nWith AQ and NOP, a portion of the [2H] spared from methanogenesis was lost as gH2. The relationship between gH2 and CH4 production seems to be treatment-dependent. Indeed, no overall correlation between variables was observed in the present study in agreement with Wang et al. (2016), whereas positive correlations were observed within treatments (CON: r = 0.80, P < 0.001; NIT: r = 0.54, P = 0.014; NOP: r = 0.74, P < 0.001; AQ: r = 0.67, P = 0.001; Supplementary Figure 1), highlighting the specificity of each methanogenesis inhibitor on rumen fermentation. Qiao et al. (2015) also observed a positive response in CH4 production to the replacement of headspace N2 with H2 in in vitro mixed batch cultures.\\nGaseous H2 was not correlated with dH2 concentrations, which agrees with Wang et al. (2014) but not with Wang et al. (2016) who reported a positive and quadratic relationship between these two variables. Calculation of the supersaturation factor (Sf, ratio of actual to calculated dH2 concentration based on gH2 partial pressure and Henry's law; Wang et al., 2014) indicated variable supersaturation of dH2 in the medium depending upon the treatment (Sf = 20.0, 77.1, 5.01, and 6.16 for CON, NIT, NOP, and AQ respectively; data not shown). The absence of equilibrium between gH2 and dH2 shows that it is not possible to use one to predict the other, and supports the complex theory of mass transfer limitation from the liquid to gaseous phase (Pauss et al., 1990). To foster a more global approach, the relationship between dissolved and gaseous H2 shows the interest of studying microbial biofilm structures. For instance, treatments may affect parameters involved in metabolite transfer between microorganisms, such as the diffusion coefficients, the concentration of metabolites or the distance between microbes (Leng, 2014).\\nFinally, it is commonly suggested that ruminal H2 should be maintained at low concentration to favor hydrogenase and ferredoxin reductase activity, which are two essential enzymes involved in the regeneration of reduced coenzymes produced during routine fermentation processes (Hegarty and Gerdes, 1999). With greater dissolved H2 concentrations, NOP contradicts this theory as substrate degradability was not modified, suggesting that the availability of oxidized coenzymes was not affected. Similarly, Guyader et al. (2015a) observed an increase of dissolved H2 concentrations in the rumen of cows supplemented with nitrate, without reduction of diet digestibility. Therefore, the effect of increased H2 concentration on ruminal fermentation requires further attention.\\nJanssen (2010) suggested that [2H] consuming pathways, such as propionogenesis, would be favored with greater [2H] concentrations. However, in our study, no treatment affected propionate production (P = 0.219; data not shown) despite increasing H2 concentrations with NOP or AQ. This result may indicate that a decrease in methanogenesis would not modify glucose production through gluconeogenesis from propionate, although this effect has yet to be confirmed in vivo.\\nAn increase in the average carbon chain length of end products linked to greater [2H] availability has been reported previously with the use of redox mediators as methanogenesis inhibitors (neutral red, methyl viologen, safranin O, and tannic acid; Nerdahl and Weimer, 2015). Similarly, with NOP and AQ, part of [2H] spared from methanogenesis was diverted toward the production of more energy-dense and reduced straight-chain VFA. Caproate may have been mainly produced through the propionyl-CoA pathway given that the [2H] recovery was closer to 100% with SC1.\\nGreater efficiency of microbial protein synthesis with NIT raises the question of the role of microbial biomass as an alternative [2H] sink. The principal component analysis revealed a negative correlation between EMPS and reduced VFA, suggesting that these pathways compete for [2H] spared from CH4 production. Mills et al. (2001) estimated that 0.41 moles [2H] would be used per gram of microbial matter produced growing on NPN, which is close to the conditions of the present work. Then, assuming a constant microbial CP content of 54.5 g per gram of dry cell (Reichl and Baldwin, 1975) and a N content in microbial protein of 16%, daily [2H] used for microbial biomass synthesis would average 1.62, 1.89, 1.48, and 1.41 moles for CON, NIT, NOP, and AQ, respectively, representing 2.91, 3.63, 3.16, and 2.78% of [2H] produced (SC1) for the respective treatments. These percentages are in the range of previous estimations (Mills et al., 2001), and support previous suggestions that microbial biomass makes a relatively small contribution to [2H] sinks (Czerkawski, 1986; Mills et al., 2001).\\nThat said, possible changes in microbial composition as a consequence of modified [2H] availability have not been taken into account in previous calculations, and it is possible that this could increase the importance of microbial biomass as an alternative [2H] sink. Indeed, an increase in [2H] availability as observed with NOP and AQ may increase the ratio of saturated to unsaturated microbial fatty acids in cells membrane. As proposed by Ungerfeld (2015), further studies should explore the effect of methanogenesis inhibition on microbial biomass amount and composition. Analysis of changes in the microbial community composition induced by methanogenesis inhibition using molecular techniques is also important (Denman et al., 2015; Martinez-Fernandez et al., 2016).\\nNitrate, nitrooxypropanol, and anthraquinone differently affected the fate of [2H] spared from decreased methanogenesis. Through its role as an electron acceptor, nitrate mostly decreased [2H] availability. Nitrooxypropanol and anthraquinone increased the amount of reduced VFA, but this was not sufficient to incorporate all extra [2H] available. As a consequence, gH2 increased as a way of evacuating the excess [2H]. Further work is needed to examine ways of efficiently utilizing energy spared from methanogenesis to improve animal performance. Moreover, as [2H] recovery was lower than 60% with CON, NOP, and AQ, future studies should aim at understanding the modifications in metabolic pathways (such as caproate formation) and microbial fatty acid composition resulting from CH4 decrease in order to improve our understanding of [2H] production and utilization. From a practical point of view, this study also showed the importance of a daily supplementation of NIT, NOP, and AQ to maintain a sustained reduction in CH4, despite some persistent modifications in VFA profile after removal of the inhibitors.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Moraxella catarrhalis (Mcat) is a prominent mucosal pathogen causing acute otitis media (AOM). We studied Mcat nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization, AOM frequency and mucosal antibody responses to four vaccine candidate Mcat proteins: outer membrane protein (OMP) CD, oligopeptide permease (Opp) A, hemagglutinin (Hag), and Pilin A clade 2 (PilA2) from stringently defined otitis prone (sOP) children, who experience the greatest burden of disease, compared to non-otitis prone (NOP) children. sOP children had higher NP colonization of Mcat (30 vs. 22%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.0003) and Mcat-caused AOM rates (49 vs. 24%, P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) than NOP children. Natural acquisition of mucosal antibodies to Mcat proteins OMP CD (IgG, P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001), OppA (IgG, P\\u2009=\\u20090.018), Hag (IgG and IgA, both P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001), and PilA2 (IgA, P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) was lower in sOP than NOP children. Higher levels of mucosal IgG to Hag (P\\u2009=\\u20090.039) and PilA2 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.0076), and IgA to OMP CD (P\\u2009=\\u20090.010), OppA (P\\u2009=\\u20090.030), and PilA2 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.043) were associated with lower carriage of Mcat in NOP but not sOP children. Higher levels of mucosal IgG to OMP CD (P\\u2009=\\u20090.0070) and Hag (P\\u2009=\\u20090.0003), and IgA to Hag (P\\u2009=\\u20090.0067) at asymptomatic colonization than those at onset of AOM were associated with significantly lower rate of Mcat NP colonization progressing to AOM in NOP compared to sOP children (3 vs. 26%, P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001). In conclusion, sOP children had a diminished mucosal antibody response to Mcat proteins, which was associated with higher frequencies of asymptomatic NP colonization and NP colonization progressing to Mcat-caused AOM. Enhancing Mcat antigen-specific mucosal immune responses to levels higher than achieved by natural exposure will be necessary to prevent AOM in sOP children.\\nOtitis prone (OP) defines a health status of children who have recurrent AOM, with at least three episodes in 6\\u2009months or four episodes in a 12-month time span (13, 14). To meet the definition of stringently defined otitis prone (sOP), a child must have every episode proven by a tympanocentesis-derived middle ear fluid (MEF) positive culture of an otopathogen while non-otitis prone (NOP) children are those with 0–2 episodes of AOM per year (14, 15). Because sOP children are most vulnerable to AOM, they should be the focused population of vaccination against AOM. Evaluating naturally induced humoral immune responses to Mcat proteins may disclose the immunogenicity of these antigens and functional activity of the antibodies elicited by these proteins in the targeted age and most vulnerable population, especially sOP children. We have found that during nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization by Mcat all four antigens, OMP CD, OppA, Hag, and PilA2, are immunogenic in both sOP and NOP children (16). The age-dependent increase of naturally induced serum antibody ranked as OppA\\u2009>\\u2009Hag5–9\\u2009>\\u2009OMP CD\\u2009>\\u2009PilA2 in both sOP and NOP children (Ren et al., unpublished). We also found that sOP children have deficient production of serum antibodies to OMP CD, OppA, Hag, and PilA2 at asymptomatic Mcat NP colonization and onset of AOM (Ren et al., unpublished), similar to our findings for protein vaccine candidates of Spn (17) and NTHi (18).\\nMoraxella catarrhalis is a mucosal pathogen and mucosal immunity plays an important role in host defense against Mcat infections. Here, we studied Mcat NP colonization, AOM frequency and mucosal antibody responses to four vaccine candidate Mcat proteins, OMP CD, OppA, Hag, and PilA2 in nasal washes from sOP compared to NOP children to identify differences in pathogenicity and mucosal immune responses.\\nRates of Mcat NP Colonization and Percentages of Children with Mcat-Caused AOM in sOP and NOP Children\\nNasopharyngeal colonization of otopathogens is the first step in pathogenesis of AOM (23). We analyzed the rates of Mcat NP colonization in 68 sOP and 560 NOP children and assessed the percentage of children with Mcat-caused AOM in each population (Figure 1). Mcat NP colonization rates were consistently higher in sOP vs. NOP children: 33 vs. 27% at age 6\\u2009months, 31 vs. 25% at age 9\\u2009months, 34 vs. 26% at age 12\\u2009months, 26 vs. 23% at age 15\\u2009months, 26 vs. 23% at age 18\\u2009months, 36 vs. 22% at age 24\\u2009months (P\\u2009=\\u20090.010), 23 vs. 11% at age 30–36\\u2009months (P\\u2009=\\u20090.006), and overall 30 vs. 22% at age 6–36\\u2009months old (P\\u2009=\\u20090.0003, Figure 1A). The relative risk of Mcat NP colonization for sOP:NOP children was 1.7 at age 24\\u2009months old, 2.1 at age 30–36\\u2009months old, and overall 1.3-fold higher for age 6–36\\u2009months old.\\nMoraxella catarrhalis (Mcat) nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization rates and percentages of Mcat-caused acute otitis media (AOM) in stringently defined otitis prone (sOP) and non-otitis prone (NOP) children. (A) 60 sOP children and 560 NOP children were assessed for Mcat NP colonization rates at 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 30–36\\u2009months old, respectively. (B) 75 sOP children and 255 NOP children with AOM history were assessed for the percentage of children with Mcat-caused AOM. Data are represented as percentage\\u2009±\\u200995% confidence interval. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the difference of rates or percentages between sOP and NOP children. *P\\u2009<\\u20090.05, **P\\u2009<\\u20090.01, and ****P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001 comparing sOP vs. NOP children.\\nThirty seven of 75 (49%) sOP children with AOM had Mcat-caused AOM, which is significantly higher than 62 of 255 (24%) NOP children with AOM (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001, Figure 1B). The relative risk of Mcat-caused AOM for sOP:NOP was thus twofold higher.\\nMucosal Antibody Levels Against Mcat Proteins in sOP and NOP Children\\nWe analyzed mucosal IgG and IgA antibodies in nasal wash samples from 238 healthy visits of 59 sOP children and 270 healthy visits of 75 NOP children age 6–36\\u2009months old. sOP children had significantly lower levels of mucosal IgG to OMP CD (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001), OppA (P\\u2009=\\u20090.018), and Hag5–9 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) than NOP children (Figure 2A). Similarly, sOP children had significantly lower levels of mucosal IgA antibody to Hag5–9 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) and PilA2 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) than NOP children (Figure 2B). We did not find a significant difference of mucosal IgG and IgA to the four Mcat proteins among different age time points 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, and 30–36\\u2009months in either sOP or NOP children (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Mucosal IgG levels to four proteins could be ranked as OMP CD\\u2009=\\u2009OppA\\u2009=\\u2009Hag5–9\\u2009>\\u2009PilA2 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) in sOP and NOP children altogether. Mucosal IgA levels to the four proteins could be ranked as Hag5–9\\u2009>\\u2009OMP CD\\u2009>\\u2009OppA\\u2009>\\u2009PilA2 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) in sOP and NOP children altogether (Figure 2).\\nMucosal antibody levels against Moraxella catarrhalis (Mcat) proteins in stringently defined otitis prone (sOP) and non-otitis prone (NOP) children. Nasal wash IgG and IgA against Mcat proteins outer membrane protein (OMP) CD, oligopeptide permease A (OppA), Hag5–9, and Pilin A clade 2 (PilA2) were detected by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for children age 6–36\\u2009months old. Mcat protein-specific (A) IgG and (B) IgA in nasal wash were compared between 238 healthy visits of 59 sOP children and 270 healthy visits of 75 NOP children. IgG and IgA concentrations (ng/ml) were normalized with total IgG and IgA concentrations (μg/ml) in nasal wash, respectively, for comparison. Data are represented as geometric mean\\u2009±\\u200995% confidence interval. Mann–Whitney test was used for comparisons. *P\\u2009<\\u20090.05 and ****P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001 comparing sOP vs. NOP children.\\nMucosal Antibodies to Mcat Proteins at Healthy Visits with vs. without NP Colonization in sOP and NOP Children\\nWe compared the association of NP colonization status with mucosal antibody responses between sOP and NOP children at age 6–36\\u2009months old. We analyzed 107 healthy visits with positive Mcat NP colonization and 131 healthy visits with negative Mcat NP colonization for 59 sOP children. sOP children did not show a difference of mucosal IgG (Figure 3A) or IgA (Figure 3B) to any of the four protein antigens comparing Mcat NP colonization positive and negative visits. We also analyzed 130 healthy visits with Mcat NP colonization positive and 140 healthy visits with Mcat NP colonization negative for 75 NOP children. In contrast, NOP children without Mcat NP colonization had significantly higher mucosal IgG to Hag5–9 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.039) and PilA2 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.0076) than NOP children with Mcat NP colonization (Figure 3C). NOP children without Mcat NP colonization displayed a significantly higher mucosal IgA to OMP CD (P\\u2009=\\u20090.010), OppA (P\\u2009=\\u20090.030), and PilA2 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.043) than NOP children with Mcat NP colonization (Figure 3D).\\nComparison of mucosal antibodies to Moraxella catarrhalis (Mcat) proteins between visits with and without Mcat nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization in stringently defined otitis prone (sOP) and non-otitis prone (NOP) children. Nasal wash IgG and IgA against Mcat proteins outer membrane protein (OMP) CD, oligopeptide permease A (OppA), Hag5–9, and Pilin A clade 2 (PilA2) were detected by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for children age 6–36\\u2009months old. (A,B) 107 healthy visits with Mcat NP colonization positive and 131 healthy visits with Mcat NP colonization negative of 59 sOP children were analyzed for nasal wash (A) IgG and (B) IgA. (C,D) 130 healthy visits with Mcat NP colonization positive and 140 healthy visits with Mcat NP colonization negative of 75 NOP children were analyzed for nasal wash (C) IgG and (D) IgA. Mcat protein-specific IgG and IgA concentrations (ng/ml) were normalized with total IgG and IgA concentrations (μg/ml) in nasal wash, respectively, for comparison. Data are shown as geometric mean\\u2009±\\u200995% confidence interval. Mann–Whitney test was used for comparison. *P\\u2009<\\u20090.05 and **P\\u2009<\\u20090.01 comparing Mcat NP non-colonized vs. colonized visits in the same population of children.\\nIn addition, mucosal IgG and IgA to Mcat proteins were examined for 50 healthy visits of 22 NOP children currently not colonized by Mcat but with Mcat colonization history and compared to those for 90 healthy visits of 25 NOP children who had never been colonized by Mcat (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). We did not find a significant difference of mucosal antibody levels between these two groups of children (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05, Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). Two out of 22 (9%) NOP children currently not colonized by Mcat but with Mcat NP colonization history experienced one episode of Mcat-caused AOM whereas 3 out of 25 (12%) of the NOP children never colonized by Mcat experienced one to two episodes of Mcat-caused AOM. There was no difference of Mcat-caused AOM rate between the two groups of children (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). We did not find a difference of Mcat protein-specific mucosal antibodies between the children experiencing AOM and those without experiencing AOM in either group of NOP children (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Therefore, prior Mcat NP colonization did not have a significant effect on mucosal anti-Mcat protein antibody levels and Mcat-caused AOM frequency in the NOP children without current Mcat NP colonization; however, the statistical power to detect differences was limited by the samples size of subjects and colonization/AOM events.\\nMucosal Antibodies to Mcat Proteins at Healthy Visits with Mcat NP Colonization vs. AOM Visits in sOP and NOP Children\\nMoraxella catarrhalis NP colonization is an immunizing event producing systemic and mucosal antibodies which may confer protection against subsequent NP colonization and AOM infections. We compared the mucosal antibodies at asymptomatic colonization by Mcat vs. onset of Mcat-caused AOM to analyze the association of natural antibody induction with protection against AOM in both sOP and NOP children. Mucosal IgG and IgA were analyzed for 107 and 130 Mcat NP colonization visits of 47 sOP and 61 NOP children, respectively, and 42 and 43 Mcat-caused AOM visits of 31 sOP and 37 NOP children, respectively. sOP children did not show a higher mucosal IgG (Figure 4A) or IgA (Figure 4B) to any of the four Mcat proteins at Mcat NP colonization compared to those at onset of AOM except a higher mucosal IgG to Hag5–9 upon Mcat NP colonization than that at onset of AOM (P\\u2009=\\u20090.015, Figure 4A). In contrast, NOP children displayed higher mucosal IgG to OMP CD (P\\u2009=\\u20090.0070, Figure 4C) and Hag5–9 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.0003, Figure 4C) and IgA to Hag5–9 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.0067, Figure 4D) at Mcat NP colonization than that at onset of AOM. There was a significantly higher rate of Mcat NP colonization progressing to AOM in sOP children (28 in total of 107 Mcat NP colonization positive visits, 26%) than that in NOP children (4 in total of 130 Mcat NP colonization positive visits, 3%) (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001, Figure 5). The relative risk of asymptomatic colonization progressing to AOM for sOP was 8.5-fold higher than NOP children.\\nMucosal antibodies to Moraxella catarrhalis (Mcat) proteins at healthy visits with Mcat nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization vs. acute otitis media (AOM) visits in stringently defined otitis prone (sOP) and non-otitis prone (NOP) children.

Ninety five percent CI (error bar) for NOP children cannot be calculated by Fisher’s exact test due to only four (less than five) episodes of Mcat NP colonization progressing to AOM in NOP children.

In this study, we found that sOP children displayed more frequent AOMs and asymptomatic NP colonizations caused by Mcat than NOP children, which is consistent with our prior observations on Mcat as well as otopathogens Spn and NTHi (24). Our previous study of children enrolled during years 2006–2011 showed that sOP children had a higher Mcat NP colonization rate than NOP children at age 6–12\\u2009months old (24). However, when we included more subjects enrolled during years 2011–2016, sOP children exhibited higher Mcat NP colonization rates than NOP children at a later age phase of 24–36\\u2009months old, which suggests that Mcat NP colonization trends to be more prevalent in older sOP children during more recent years. Indeed, Mcat has been considered a less virulent bacterium than Spn or NTHi and has not been associated with TM rupture or severe illness in young children (25). However, during our 10-year (2006–2016) prospective, longitudinal clinical, and translational studies of AOM, only since 2013 have we observed cases of severe AOM symptoms and TM rupture caused by Mcat (Pichichero et al., unpublished observations), suggesting that the virulence of Mcat as an otopathogen may be increasing. Mcat causing TM rupture was first described in Israel in 2009 (25) and in Italy in 2017 (26), suggesting the emergence of more virulent Mcat is a potentially significant problem of global proportions. Also, Mcat NP colonization rates have significantly increased since the introduction of pneumococcal glycoconjugate vaccines in children (27). The pattern of Mcat NP colonization increase in our study may be due to the higher prevalence of emerging virulent Mcat strains in older sOP children age 24–36\\u2009months.\\nStudies have shown that AOM has a multifactorial etiology (4). The mechanism of OP has been attributed to many pathogenic factors, such as preceding upper respiratory infection, immature Eustachian tube, social and environmental risk factors (day care environment, parent smoking, multiple siblings at home, etc.) (4), and importantly the delayed maturation of the child’s immune systems as identified by our group (15). In this study, we observed decreased mucosal IgG and IgA responses to all four Mcat proteins in sOP children at healthy visits, which is in concert with our prior observations on diminished serum and/or mucosal antibody responses to Spn (17, 24), NTHi (18), and Mcat (Ren et al., unpublished) protein antigens in this population. In accordance with our prior findings on serum antibody responses (16), high mucosal antibodies correlated with low Mcat NP carriage, suggesting protection by naturally acquired Mcat protein-specific mucosal antibodies in NOP but not sOP children. Verhaegh and coworkers had similar findings. They showed serum IgG levels to MID962-1200 were higher in 2-year-old children without Mcat NP colonization compared to children with Mcat NP colonization (28).\\nAge of the child and preexisting antibody levels are important covariates in predicting an antibody response to NP colonization. Our prior studies showed varied serum IgG responses during NP colonization of Spn and NTHi vs. non-NP colonization in children age 6–30\\u2009months old (19, 20, 24). Spn and NTHi also display differences from Mcat in producing acute responses to AOM (29). Thus, different pathogens may evoke different patterns of antibody responses in relation to NP colonization in young children, reinforcing the need for systematic study of each organism in different hosts. However, consistent with our prior observations on antibody responses to Spn and NTHi, sOP children tend to produce lower mucosal antibody responses to natural exposure to Mcat proteins than NOP children suggestive of a more neonatal-like, delayed immune maturation response.\\nMucosal antibodies to OMP CD (22, 30) and Hag (9, 31) have been detected in healthy adults and in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Mucosal antibodies to Hag have also been observed in young children (32). The current results show that all four Mcat protein antigens are immunogenic with regard to mucosal antibodies in young children. The mucosal IgG levels to four Mcat proteins could be ranked as OMP CD\\u2009=\\u2009OppA\\u2009=\\u2009Hag5–9\\u2009>\\u2009PilA2 while mucosal IgA levels to four Mcat proteins could be ranked as Hag5–9\\u2009>\\u2009OMP CD\\u2009>\\u2009OppA\\u2009>\\u2009PilA2 in both sOP and NOP children. The current mucosal data support our prior serum data that OMP CD, OppA, and Hag5–9 exhibit promising immunogenicity for Mcat vaccine candidates (16).\\nHigh frequency of NP colonization of otopathogens Spn, NTHi, and Mcat is associated with increased development of AOM (35). Among the three otopathogens, early colonization with Mcat is associated with the greatest risk of AOM and otitis media with effusion (35). Our results had consistent findings for sOP children of lower production of mucosal IgG and IgA to Mcat proteins upon NP colonization and a higher rate of progressing to Mcat-caused AOM. On the other hand, NOP children had higher mucosal antibodies to Mcat proteins and lower rates of NP colonization progressing to AOM (>8 times lower than sOP children). Mucosal immunity is the frontline of host defense against bacterial infections. Enhanced bactericidal effect of IgG and coating of bacteria with sIgA to inhibit bacterial adherence to respiratory epithelia may account for the protection against AOM observed in this study.\\nIn summary, sOP children had higher NP colonization of Mcat, Mcat-caused AOM rates and a higher percentage of Mcat NP colonization progressing to Mcat-caused AOM than NOP children. These pathogenesis events and outcomes correlate with impaired mucosal antibody responses to Mcat protein antigens. Mucosal vaccination with immunogenic Mcat antigens and developing mucosal adjuvants should be pursued for preventing AOM caused by Mcat, with special attention to the sOP child.\\n',\n",
       " '3-Nitrooxypropanol (NOP) is a promising methane (CH 4 ) inhibitor. Recent studies have shown major reductions in CH 4  emissions from beef and dairy cattle when using NOP but with large variation in response. The objective of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the factors that explain heterogeneity in response to NOP using meta-analytical approaches. Data from 11 experiments and 38 treatment means were used. Factors considered were cattle type (dairy or beef), measurement technique (GreenFeed technique, C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD; sulfur hexafluoride tracer technique; and respiration chamber technique), dry matter (DM) intake, body weight, NOP dose, roughage proportion, dietary crude protein content, and dietary neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content. The mean difference (MD) in CH 4  production (g/d) and CH 4  yield (g/kg of DM intake) was calculated by subtracting the mean of CH 4  emission for the control group from that of the NOP-supplemented group. Forest plots of standardized MD indicated variable effect sizes of NOP across studies. Compared with beef cattle, dairy cattle had a much larger feed intake (22.3 ± 4.13 vs. 7.3 ± 0.97 kg of DM/d; mean ± standard deviation) and CH 4  production (351 ± 94.1 vs. 124 ± 44.8 g/d). Therefore, in further analyses across dairy and beef cattle studies, MD was expressed as a proportion (%) of observed control mean. The final mixed-effect model for relative MD in CH 4  production included cattle type, NOP dose, and NDF content. When adjusted for NOP dose and NDF content, the CH 4 -mitigating effect of NOP was less in beef cattle (-22.2 ± 3.33%) than in dairy cattle (-39.0 ± 5.40%). An increase of 10 mg/kg of DM in NOP dose from its mean (123 mg/kg of DM) enhanced the NOP effect on CH 4  production decline by 2.56 ± 0.550%. However, a greater dietary NDF content impaired the NOP effect on CH 4  production by 1.64 ± 0.330% per 10 g/kg DM increase in NDF content from its mean (331 g of NDF/kg of DM). The factors included in the final mixed-effect model for CH 4  yield were -17.1 ± 4.23% (beef cattle) and -38.8 ± 5.49% (dairy cattle), -2.48 ± 0.734% per 10 mg/kg DM increase in NOP dose from its mean, and 1.52 ± 0.406% per 10 g/kg DM increase in NDF content from its mean. In conclusion, the present meta-analysis indicates that a greater NOP dose enhances the NOP effect on CH 4  emission, whereas an increased dietary fiber content decreases its effect. 3-Nitrooxypropanol has stronger antimethanogenic effects in dairy cattle than in beef cattle.\\n',\n",
       " 'The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 3-nitrooxypropanol (NOP) on gas production, rumen fermentation, and animal performances depending on animal type using a meta-analysis approach. A database consisted of data from 14 studies, 18 experiments and 55 treatments. The supplementation of NOP linearly decreased methane (CH 4 ) emissions [g/kg dry matter intake (DMI)] regardless of animal type and length of experimental period (beef,  p  < 0.0001,  R   2  = 0.797; dairy,  p  = 0.0003,  R   2  = 0.916; and long term,  p  < 0.0001,  R   2  = 0.910). The total volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentration and the proportion of acetate, based on beef cattle database, were significantly decreased with increasing NOP supplementation ( p  = 0.0015,  R   2  = 0.804 and  p  = 0.0003,  R   2  = 0.918), whereas other individual VFAs was increased. Based on the dairy database, increasing levels of NOP supplementation linearly decreased proportion of acetate ( p  = 0.0284,  R   2  = 0.769) and increased that of valerate ( p  = 0.0340,  R   2  = 0.522), regardless of significant change on other individual VFAs. In animal performances, the DMI, from beef cattle database, tended to decrease when the levels of NOP supplementation increased ( p  = 0.0574,  R   2  = 0.170), whereas there was no significant change on DMI from dairy cattle database. The NOP supplementation tended to decrease milk yield ( p  = 0.0606,  R   2  = 0.381) and increase milk fat and milk protein ( p  = 0.0861,  R   2  = 0.321,  p  = 0.0838,  R   2  = 0.322). NOP is a viable candidate as a feed additive because of its CH 4  mitigation effects, regardless of animal type and experiment period, without adverse effects on animal performances.\\n',\n",
       " 'Alternatively, spontaneous object exploration in rodent studies of recognition memory is a well-established training-free animal model. This test is based on the natural tendency of many species to explore novel stimuli. For example, the length of time spent on exploring a novel object is compared with the time engaged in exploring a familiar object. The difference between the duration of exploration of a novel versus familiar object can be taken as an indication for memory, by the argument that animals tend to explore novel objects more because they remember the familiar ones (Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988). Caution must be exercised to rule out confounding interpretations, such as the absence of preference for a given object, fear of novelty, hyper- or hypo-locomotor activity, sensorimotor malfunctions and others. These factors can be monitored before and during the tests. Spontaneous object exploration can be used to assess memory for “what” (novel object preference; NOP) (Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988), for “where” (object place preference; OPP) (Ennaceur et al., 1997), and for “when” (memory for temporal order or recency; TOM) (Mitchell and Laiacona, 1998). A direct way to measure episodic-like memory is to combine the three “what”, “where” and “when” object exploration tests into one integrated paradigm (this test was first developed for rats (Kart-Teke et al., 2006) and then adapted for mice (Dere et al., 2005b). In this test, two sets of four objects (what) are placed at different locations (where), whereby the temporal appearance of each set of objects is also different (when). Based on the experimental model, episodic-like memory has been found to be not simply a combination of “what”, “where” and “when” memories, but a meta-system which integrates these three components into a complex and distinct compound system (de Souza Silva et al., 2016).\\nFollowing the same principle of combining the NOP, OPP and TOM tests, various episodic-like memory paradigms were developed (Davis et al., 2013a; Davis et al., 2013b; Good et al., 2007a; Good et al., 2007b). For example, two distinct objects were presented, followed by another two distinct objects at different locations, and then all the four objects were placed, while the object-locations of one of the two objects from each temporal set was interchanged. As a result, the characteristic of each object applied is determined by what type of object, when it was shown and where it appeared, similar to the Kart-Teke et al paradigm (2006). Recently, Barker and colleagues exploited this variant of episodic-like memory test and found important neurobiological correlates to episodic-like memory (Barker et al., 2017) (see section 4.2).\\nHere we will detail the properties of spontaneous object exploration paradigms, the NOP (what), OPP (where) and TOM (when) tests, and the integrative episodic-like memory paradigms. We will focus on the evidence primarily found via training-free models in rodents and propose a working hypothesis that identifies the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and hippocampus as key brain substrates of a neuronal network that subserves episodic memory. The neurotransmitter systems within the mPFC and hippocampus are crucial for the processing of memory and will also be discussed. We will primarily refer to the articles published after 2007 since the findings of NOP, OPP and TOM tests have been summarized (Dere et al., 2007). “Context”-manipulated object exploration tests, e.g., the What-Where-Which test (Davis et al., 2013b; Eacott and Norman, 2004), will not be reviewed. We consider that this topic is worthy to be discussed in a separate article, since it has been actively studied and debated in concept and experimental definition of context, particularly in the context (source) of episodic memory.\\nNovel object preference (NOP)\\nThe term “novel object preference (NOP)” applies to the situation where an animal spends more time exploring a novel object than a familiar one. The NOP test has become one of the most frequently used behavioral paradigms in the fields of neurobiology, psychopharmacology and behavioral neuroscience in the past two decades (Ennaceur and de Souza Silva, 2018).\\nThe NOP test are said to utilize no obvious positive or negative reinforcer and to be dependent on the natural tendency of rodents to explore novel objects more than old ones (Berlyne, 1950; Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988). However, all behaviors are “motivated” and guided by positive and negative outcomes (reinforcers). One can argue that the exploration of novelty is likely motivated by the possibility of a potential source of reward, i.e., positive reinforcement, but also by negative reinforcement, such as escape from boredom and reduction of anxiety/fear, in the case it turns out to be that the novel object is not dangerous or threatening, i.e., has a benign outcome. Novel object exploration might also be influenced by motivation for social interaction (with the object) or by novelty seeking; i.e., novelty per se being a reinforcer. Conversely, animals may fear a novel object, and a neophobic animal might explore less, without necessarily meaning that it does not remember. A change in NOP resulting from a brain lesion, pharmacological challenge or genetic manipulation could, therefore, be a consequence of action on any of these potential variables that can influence object exploration. These variables have not been earnestly considered in the literature using the NOP test.\\nIn rodents, the classical design of the NOP test involves a sample/encoding/learning trial and a test/retrieval/recall trial, separated by a time delay/retention interval. During the sample trial, two identical objects are presented in a testing arena (usually an open field to which animals are previously habituated). In the test trial, one of these is replaced by a novel unknown, but comparably preferred, object (Fig.1A, top). Since two distinct objects are presented in the test trial, their locations should be counter-balanced between subjects to minimize the possible bias of object-location. A preference for exploring the novel object over the familiar one indicates memory of the familiar object that was previously explored in the sample trial. The time differences between the exploration of familiar and novel objects are subtracted and used for the binary judgement of the object memory. Details about how to measure, calculate and perform statistics for the exploration differences can be found in these articles (Akkerman et al., 2012a; Akkerman et al., 2012b). The popular nomenclature of this paradigm, “novel object recognition”, somehow misrepresents the concept of this test, since, instead of recognizing the novel object, the one recognized is the familiar one (Ennaceur, 2010). A term such as “novel object preference” or simply “object recognition”, for exploring the novel object better reflects that the underlying memory is for the previously explored object.\\nNotwithstanding, some researchers apply two distinct objects in the sample trial of the NOP paradigm (Fig.1A, bottom). Compared to the application of identical objects, that of distinct objects is likely to involve not only novel object identity, but also inter-object relationship (Arain et al., 2012), which presumably activates brain regions for the processing of object-object and/or object-context association more than that for object identity. Not many studies have tried to differentiate the underlying mechanism of the NOP test with applying identical objects in the sample trial from that with distinct objects. When two distinct objects were placed in one context, followed by presenting two copies of one of the familiar objects in another new context, rats showed object preference according to the local cues, but not the spatial ones (Poulter et al., 2013), implying that animals were able to remember the relationship between distinct objects. Animals could recognize them as changes of local features, which has been shown to impact object recognition in animals with lesions on the hippocampus (Piterkin et al., 2008) and LEC (Kuruvilla and Ainge, 2017). In the object-location recognition test in which two distinct objects were presented, followed by two identical objects chosen from either the previously used ones, the LEC lesioned rats showed deficient performance, but not in the NOP test (Wilson et al., 2013c). Although the object-location recognition test measures whether animals remember the location of the changed object, it could potentially also be involved in the memory for the change of inter-object relationship (recognition on the alteration of local features). In a study of disconnecting mPFC and LEC, the memory tested by the NOP test with identical objects was intact, but not when distinct objects were applied during the learning (Chao et al., 2016a). Similarly, deficits were found in LEC lesioned rats when four distinct objects, but not when four identical objects, were presented to be learned (Rodo et al., 2017).This suggests that the recognition memory for identical objects is not as the same as the memory for distinct objects.\\nThe NOP paradigm has sometimes been called and used to assess “episodic-like memory”, partly due to the conceptual similarity between the memory systems of recognition memory and of episodic memory. Although NOP processing could be involved in episodic memory, at least in the property of “what”, NOP memory does not necessarily demonstrate the properties of “where” and “when”. Thus, the NOP test, per se, is not an appropriate measurement of “episodic-like memory”.\\nHere we only discuss the methodological factors of NOP. Factors that directly influence the biological states of experimental animals, such as species (Stranahan, 2011), strains, colony conditions, gender (van Goethem et al., 2012), stress (Eagle et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Nava-Mesa et al., 2013), early experience (McLean et al., 2010; Plescia et al., 2014), diet (Beilharz et al., 2014; Sarfert et al., 2017) etc., are not in the scope of this review.\\nSimilar to many other behavioral paradigms, any factor involved in either one of the NOP procedural steps can influence the outcome. One factor is the habituation to the testing arena which is used to reduce anxiety and arousal levels of animals (Okuda et al., 2004; Roozendaal et al., 2006). Animals which were not habituated to a testing environment had a twofold higher plasma corticosterone level (Okuda et al., 2004) and displayed more anxiety-related behavior in the open-field test (Maroun and Akirav, 2008) compared to habituated ones. NOP memory tested 24 hours later was found to be disrupted in the non-habituated, but not in the habituated animals (Maroun and Akirav, 2008). Interestingly, exposure to a stressor (30 min on an elevated platform with lights) immediately after the sample trial of NOP, reversed the effects on the habituated and non-habituated animals (Maroun and Akirav, 2008). This suggests that the initial level of arousal (related to habituation versus non-habituation) interacts with the stressor following the learning and influences NOP consolidation. Habituation to the testing environment, which reduces novelty-induced arousal or anxiety, directly contributes to memory for objects. Thus, a habituation procedure is important for NOP testing (Yi et al., 2016) and should be conducted unless experiments are designed to test stress-related issues. In the same vein, any treatment which causes deficiency in habituation learning, such as lesion, pharmacological administration, gene knockout, opto- and chemogenetic manipulations etc., should be considered as a confounding factor when NOP performance is impaired. The procedure of environmental habituation varies among different laboratories, such as absence or presence of objects inside the testing arena (Besheer and Bevins, 2000). For pharmacological experiments, vehicle injections during habituation are suggested, as studies have shown that the first-time injection increases the duration of exploratory activity (Akkerman et al., 2012a).\\nThe second factor is the duration of exploration of objects. In the classic NOP test in which two identical objects were used, studies have shown that a minimum duration of object exploration (reach 10–20 seconds in rats and mice) is essential for testing NOP, both in the sample and test trials, in order to decrease large variation in the test trial (Akkerman et al., 2012a). Once the minimum amount of exploration is reached, the level of exploration in the sample trial is not correlated with the performance in the test trial (Akkerman et al., 2012a; Gaskin et al., 2010). The duration of object exploration is associated with the nature of the objects. The qualities of the objects, e.g. weight, shape, size and texture, should be well-controlled and odors from objects themselves or from animals between trials should be avoided. Objects should be heavy enough to prevent from being moved by the subjects. Any object that incurs significantly higher, lower or no exploration should not be used. Objects made of glass or porcelain are recommended since they can be easily and well cleaned. Objects that can or cannot be climbed by animals have similar but subtle effects in male C57BL/6J mice, which explored mountable objects longer than non-mountable ones and showed better discrimination between them (Heyser and Chemero, 2012). Climbing on an object can be considered as object exploration only when the head of the animal is directed towards the object, as a sign of paying attention on it. Neophobia towards objects, especially when encountering them for the first time, could be another potential factor affecting exploration of objects. Ennaceur and colleagues examined this possibility and found that rats did not exhibit neophobia towards objects (Ennaceur et al., 2009), while this issue is dependent upon the genetic backgrounds of rodents (Binder et al., 2015). A sufficient amount of object exploration time is also required to ensure that animals are not avoiding them. The biological rhythm may contribute to the level of exploration since rodents are nocturnal animals, and many studies have tested them during their “sleeping” time. Some studies on circadian phase have reported that when the NOP test was administered during rodents “sleeping time”, there was no influence on locomotor activity and object recognition (Beeler et al., 2006; Takahashi et al., 2013), but that OPP memory was affected, which has been shown to be better at night (Takahashi et al., 2013). Recent findings indicate that C57BL/6J mice kept under normal light/dark cycles perform better NOP memory at midday than midnight (Tam et al., 2017). Whereas sleep is important for memory consolidation (Binder et al., 2014; Born et al., 2006; Born and Wilhelm, 2012; Chen et al., 2014; Ishikawa et al., 2014; Prince et al., 2014), long-term NOP and OPP performance were impaired when sleep was interrupted after the learning trial (Sawangjit et al., 2018). Significant differences in memory processing may be expected in the comparison of normal versus reversed light-dark cycle. The light intensity applied during the test should not be over 350 lux, as evidenced by an impairment of NOP memory (Tam et al., 2016). To increase exploratory activity, rodents can be isolated in an empty cage for some minutes (Vanmierlo et al., 2016) or food-restricted for one week before the test (Wang et al., 2017a), although food restriction itself has been shown to have promnestic effects in adult and aged mice (Talhati et al., 2014). The definition of object exploration is variable between different laboratories. Some define object exploration as physical contact with objects, while others use exploration within a distance range, e.g. when animals approach an object within 2 cm. Compared to exploration without contact, the former criterion might underestimate the amount of exploration. The criterion for terminating the sample or test trial is also variable between studies and, thus, can influence the amount of exploration. Some apply a fixed time window of exploration, e.g. 5 min per trial, while others use a fixed amount of object exploration, e.g. when animals explore objects for 20 seconds. The amount of time for exploring objects is usually taken as a measure of attention and/or motivation for object exploration. This measure can be obtained in data collected from experiments with a fixed duration (because there is variability in the amount of object exploration), but not from a fixed amount of exploration (because the amount of object exploration is equal for all subjects). Alternatively, animals could be excluded if the duration of object exploration is below a certain level, e.g. less than 10 seconds within 5 minutes. Overall, the level of exploration of objects is essential in NOP testing and the related factors need to be controlled.\\nNOP performance is variably dependent upon the time interval between the learning and test trials (Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988). Memory weakens over time unless it is strongly consolidated. Thus, the longer the retention interval, the more likely that retrieval/memory is disrupted. The time delay between trials of the NOP is a widely applied experimental factor for studying the extent of memory. Shorter versus longer retention intervals are taken as measures of short-term versus long-term memory (Kesner and Hunsaker, 2010). When a 0 second interval is applied in the NOP test, the performance could be taken as the measurement of “object-based attention” (Alkam et al., 2011; Alkam et al., 2013), and/or of ultra-short/working memory (Chao et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017a). Early studies have indicated that rodents have memory for objects for up to 24 hours (Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988), and even up to 48 hours (Liu et al., 2016). With the help of sleep for the facilitation of NOP consolidation, the memory can be preserved for up to 3 weeks (Sawangjit et al., 2018). It is noted that the amount of object exploration in the learning trial is positively correlated with the degree of retention in regards to object exploration performance (at least within an amount of object exploration time). The longer the amount of object exploration, the more an animal remembers after a longer retention (Akkerman et al., 2012a; Federman et al., 2013; Ozawa et al., 2011). Therefore, the combination of different durations of object exploration and retention intervals can be used to create different strengths of memory. Discrepancies between studies can be due to the reason that one may apply a shorter object exploration during the sample trial to cause deficient memory after a shorter retention interval, while another might apply a longer object exploration time to establish intact memory after a longer delay. This factor is important in psychopharmacological studies, as researchers manipulate the extent of object memory to examine amnestic or promnestic effects according to the expected effect of the testing substance (Akkerman et al., 2014).\\nA test similar to the NOP test has been adapted for assessing memory for an object situated in a particular place (Ennaceur et al., 1997). The same procedure as for the NOP test is applied, except that one of the familiar objects is placed in a new location in the test trial to generate a setting for testing memory of place (Fig.1B). This design measures memory for where an object was located by testing for preference for a known object placed in a novel location. More exploration of the object at a new location than at its original location implies memory for the localization of the object in a previous location. OPP memory can be preserved longer than 1 week with the help of sleep (Sawangjit et al., 2018). In addition, it has been found that the half of the tested mice was able to retain OPP information for up to 6 months, but not after 1 year (Atucha et al., 2019).\\nThe methodological factors which impact NOP also influence the OPP test. Spatial features around the testing arena are usually provided to serve as allocentric environmental cues. Thus, possible bias toward object-location could emerge due to spatial bias within the testing arena. This factor should be eliminated or controlled by adjusting the environment and/or counter-balancing the location of objects. In some earlier studies (Escorihuela et al., 1995; Howlett et al., 2004; Hryniewicz et al., 2007), one single object was presented, followed by the copy of the explored object and a novel object. In this case, the novelty pertains not only to the location of object, but also the identity of object (since the new object was novel in both place and identity). To control this factor, the new object can be placed at the previously old location, while the explored object is placed at a novel location (trying to counter-balance the “novelty”). As this design involves complex object and place interaction, the results should be carefully explained, and may likely not reflect only OPP processing. A variant of the OPP test used two distinct objects as the sample, while in the test trial two identical objects selected from either the explored type were placed at the familiar locations (Wilson et al., 2013c). This test is intended to measure the memory for the location of the changed object. However, since two distinct objects are used in the sample trial, it could simply reflect the mnemonic changes of local features (see 2.1.). Another OPP-like paradigm applies a single object during the learning trial, followed by two copies of the explored object, with one of them placed at the old location (Van Cauter et al., 2013). Since the identity of objects remains unchanged, the underlying processing should preferentially be engaged in dealing with place. The placing of animals into the testing arena from the same or different starting locations can potentially impact an OPP-like test, as it was shown that hippocampus-leisoned rats showed a memory impairment when starting to explore from different, but not the same, locations (see 3.3.2; (Langston and Wood, 2010).\\nThe methodological factors in the NOP test are suggested to apply to the TOM test as well. Since there are two sample trials in the TOM test, the duration of exploration of objects on both sample trials should be controlled. Otherwise, a bias toward one of the presented object sets could confound the outcome. Another notable factor is the time delay between the two sample trials, which presumably affects the memory strength between the two sets of objects. The TOM test is designed for animals to remember both sets of objects, while forming differential memory decay for each one. One could argue that the earlier presented object is explored more than the later one because of the forgetting of the earlier object. To exclude this argument, a separate NOP test can be used to investigate whether animals have memory for the object encountered in the first time point by applying an inter-interval interval corresponding to the summation of the two intervals applied in the TOM test. Studies have reported that rodents can retain object information for at least 24 hours after the exposure (Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988). Related information can be found in (Hatakeyama et al., 2018), who examined in detail the number of objects used in the sample trial, the exposure time for encoding and the length of the inter-trial interval using the TOM test.\\nAlthough the procedure of this paradigm is similar to the NOP and OPP tests, the differences between the SNOP and NOP/OPP tests are significant. First, the SNOP test applies more objects and more types of objects in the sample trial than the NOP/OPP tests, which involves complicated inter-object relationships (see section2.1. the discussion of applying distinct objects for learning). In this sense, the nature of this test is akin to the object-in-place test (see section 2.5) for measuring the memory for object/location-associative information. Second, the “quantity” of changed and unchanged information is not comparable between the SNOP test and NOP/OPP tests. For example, one out of five stationary objects is spatially changed in the SNOP test (1:4), compared to one of two stationary objects replaced in the OPP test (1:1). Third, the object novelty trial is followed by the spatial novelty trial, which could potentially be influenced by a sequential effect, e.g., the animal might be more alert in the object-novelty trial since it had learned that the object-contextual environment was altered in the spatial-novelty trial. Cautions should be applied in the interpretations of this paradigm.\\nSince the SNOP paradigm involves changing spatial and object information sequentially, the methodological factors in the NOP, OPP and TOM tests are also relevant for this test.\\nCompared to the NOP and OPP tests, the OiP test presents four distinct objects, instead of two identical objects, as the information to be learned. This test is similar to the SNOP test that applies multiple distinct objects in the sample trial and presumably requires higher memory capacity to learn than the NOP/OPP tests. In addition, since four distinct objects are presented, inter-object relationships are created which would likely engage somewhat different brain regions for memory establishment (see section 2.1.). Theoretically, a failure to form an OiP memory could result from deficits in either the NOP, the OPP, the association of object and location, or their combinations. Thus, the NOP and OPP tests are usually conducted independently along with the OiP test to exclude the factors for impairments in recognition of object or location (Barker et al., 2007; Barker and Warburton, 2011b, 2015; Barker and Warburton, 2018). Whereas the number of objects are fewer in the NOP/OPP tests than in the OiP test (2 versus 4), another confounding possibility is that the OiP test may require higher memory load. If the OiP memory is disrupted, along with intact NOP and OPP performance, the compromised association of object and location might not be the sole reason.\\nThe methodological factors in NOP and OPP tests are also applicable to the OiP test.\\nThe episodic-like memory test developed by Kart-Teke et al. (2006) is meant to gauge the integration of memory for NOP (what), OPP (where) and TOM (when) (Kart-Teke et al., 2006). The combined “what-where-when” memory, however, is not merely a summation of the three mnemonic components, given that “what-where-when” memory could be impaired under the circumstance of intact individual memory for “what”, “where” and “when” (details see section 4.2). Thus, the development of such tests is essential for the understanding of the nature of the prototype of episodic memory. The Kart-Teke’s paradigm is a training-free test in which two different sets of equal objects are used (Fig.2A). Four identical objects, the first set (sample trial 1), are placed at four of eight possible different locations at the periphery of the arena and animals are allowed to explore them for a period of time. The same procedure is applied after a time delay (inter-trial interval), with four objects from the second set (sample trial 2). Two of these four objects are placed at locations which were occupied by the previously presented objects (sample trial 1), while the other two objects are placed at locations which were not occupied before. After another delay, the test trial is applied with two objects from each set placed together: One object of each set is placed at the same location it occupied before, and the other is placed at a novel location. However, all the objects are placed only at locations that have been previously occupied in sample trial 1 or 2. Thus, a specific “what-where-when” setting is created, including one older familiar object at the stationary location (OS), one older familiar object at a displaced location (OD), one recent familiar object at the stationary location (RS) and one recent familiar object at a displaced location (RD) (called ELM2–2 test here: the episodic-like memory test with the application of 2 sets of objects and displacement of 2 objects). In this test, adult rats exhibit a pattern of exploration preferences, where RD > RS (where), OS > RS (when) and OS > OD. The exploration preference patterns, RD > RS (novel location over old one in recent familiar objects) and OS > OD (old location over novel one in older familiar objects), indicates an interaction between object-location and temporal-order, which demonstrates that the animals have episodic-like memory. Based on the duration of exploration of each object in the test trial, three indices are calculated:\\nWhereindex=(RD\\xa0−\\xa0RS)/(RD\\xa0+\\xa0RS);\\nWhenindex=(OS\\xa0−\\xa0RS)/(OS\\xa0+\\xa0RS);\\nInteractionindex=(OD\\xa0−\\xa0OS)/(OD\\xa0+\\xa0OS).\\nThe third version of episodic-like memory paradigm involves in four distinct objects (called ELM4–2 test here; Fig.2C). The principle concept of the ELM4–2 test (Barker et al., 2017; Davis et al., 2013a; Good et al., 2007a; Good et al., 2007b) is comparable to the Kart-Teke et al. paradigm (2006) by presenting OS, OD, RS and RD objects. However, the differences between ELM4–2 and ELM2–2/2–1 are noted. First, the number of objects used in the sample trials is not identical (4 versus 2). Second, the types of objects are different, as four distinct objects versus two sets of identical objects, are used. This could increase the information complexity, as distinct inter-object relationships are formed in the four distinct objects paradigm. Third, the exploration pattern OD > OS is found, unlike that of the ELM2–2 test. These differences are due to the procedure for the applied number and types of objects in the sample and test trials. The comparison between the ELM4–2 and ELM2–2/ELM2–1 tests is similar to that of the NOP/OPP and SNOP/OiP tests (see sections 2.4 and 2.5). In this ELM4–2 paradigm, two indices can be calculated:\\nWhereindex=[(OD\\xa0+\\xa0RD)\\xa0−\\xa0(OS\\xa0+\\xa0RS)]/(OS\\xa0+\\xa0OD\\xa0+\\xa0RS\\xa0+\\xa0RD);\\nWhenindex=[(OS\\xa0+\\xa0OD)\\xa0−\\xa0(RS\\xa0+\\xa0RD)]/(OS\\xa0+\\xa0OD\\xa0+\\xa0RS\\xa0+\\xa0RD).\\nThe episodic-like memory paradigms (Fig.2) are dependent upon the spontaneous object exploration tests of NOP, OPP and TOM, and thus, theoretically are influenced by all the methodological factors involved in these tests. Habituation to the environment, materials and properties of objects, configurations of placement of objects, spatial cues around the environment and time intervals between trials should be carefully controlled.\\nThe PFC neurons activate for storage of object information (Smith and Jonides, 1999), and ACC neuronal firing is correlated with exploratory behavior in the NOP test (Weible et al., 2009). Furthermore, c-fos (a marker for neuronal activity) expressing in the ACC was found when rats explored a novel object more than a familiar one (Zhu et al., 1995). However, lesions in the mPFC did not affect NOP performance (Ennaceur et al., 1997; Mitchell and Laiacona, 1998), consistent with subsequent studies in rats and mice (Baran et al., 2010; Barker et al., 2007; Barker and Warburton, 2011b; Cross et al., 2012; McAllister et al., 2015; Spanswick and Dyck, 2012). Pharmacological inhibition of the mPFC with muscimol, a GABAA-R agonist, also had no effect in the NOP test when infused before the sample trial (Neugebauer et al., 2018; Pezze et al., 2017). This implies that the mPFC is either not required for object recognition memory, or that other circuits compensate for this function when the mPFC is inactivated. Optogenetic stimulation of the mPFC glutamatergic neurons did not affect memory for NOP and OPP, but facilitated OiP memory, which is involved in object association information by switching inter-object locations (Benn et al., 2016). Whether the mPFC is engaged in memory for NOP, seems to depend on the properties of the object being encoded. When distinct objects were used as samples, object memory consolidation was deficient in animals with inactivated mPFC (Akirav and Maroun, 2006). A possible explanation is that associations between distinct objects (e.g. relative inter-object locations) are processed by the mPFC, while such associative learning is not required when identical objects are applied. This interpretation is in accordance with the perspective of the role of the PFC as a flexible supporter to memory when conditions demand “specificity” (Euston et al., 2012). Consistently, lesion of the mPFC disrupted memory in the OiP test in rats (Barker et al., 2007; Barker and Warburton, 2011b; Cross et al., 2012).\\nAlternatively, the mPFC has been suggested to play a specific role in memory consolidation and retrieval. A recent study showed that inhibition of the mPFC with Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD) given after the sample trial, impaired both NOP and OPP memories tested 24 and 4 hours later, respectively (Tuscher et al., 2018), suggesting a critical engagement of the mPFC in memory consolidation (Akirav and Maroun, 2006). Pre- (Nagai et al., 2007) or post-sample (Tanimizu et al., 2018) infusions of anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, into the mPFC disrupted long-term NOP memory in mice. Also, electrical stimulation of the ventromedial PFC facilitated NOP memory and hippocampus proliferation in middle-aged rats (Liu et al., 2015). In addition, pre-test microinfusions of muscimol into the rat ACC impaired the NOP memory tested after 24 hours, but not 20 min, implying the ACC is involved in the retrieval of NOP in a time-dependent manner (Pezze et al., 2017).\\nThe prefrontal cortical neurons were found to respond to spatial goals (Hok et al., 2005) and single-cell recordings in the ACC demonstrated that the ACC is associated with OPP performance (Weible et al., 2009). In a modified NOP test in which only one of the explored objects was presented in the testing trial, some ACC neurons responded to the location of the absent object (Weible et al., 2012). When the PFC was damaged, however, the OPP memory was not influenced (Baran et al., 2010; Barker et al., 2007; Barker and Warburton, 2011b). Conversely, mice with PFC stroke showed impaired OPP, but not NOP, memory, along with reduced structural volume in the dorsal medial nucleus of the thalamus (Zhou et al., 2016). Long-term (24 hours), but not short-term (5 min), OPP memory was deficient when a cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein, histone acetyltransferase, was reduced in the mouse PFC (Vieira and Korzus, 2015). Given that the mPFC and hippocampus interact in a complementary way to process spatial information (Chao et al., 2017; Eichenbaum, 2017b; Lee and Kesner, 2003; Maharjan et al., 2018), it is possible that the object-place processing can be taken over by the hippocampus when the PFC is dysfunctional.\\nThe PFC has been considered to account for the processing of time. TOM was impaired in rodents with selective lesions of the mPFC (Barker et al., 2007; Barker and Warburton, 2011b; Cross et al., 2012; Mitchell and Laiacona, 1998) or lidocaine injection (Hannesson et al., 2004). However, TOM deficits were not found in an animal model of ischemic lesion in the mPFC (Deziel et al., 2015). The catecholaminergic systems in the PFC are involved in the processing of TOM, given that catecholamine depletion in the mPFC induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) disrupted this memory, but neither memory for NOP nor that for OPP (Nelson et al., 2011). However, this is contradicted by a similar study which reported impaired NOP memory after such a lesion (Kadowaki Horita et al., 2013). The findings in rodents are consistent with studies in human patients, with lesions to the ventromedial PFC, showing deficits in remembering past and imagining future events (Bertossi et al., 2016). The macaque ventrolateral PFC was also found to signal specific object-time relationships during a temporal order task (Naya et al., 2017).\\nGlutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain that activate ionotropic glutamate-R (e.g., AMPA-, kainate and NMDA-R) and metabotropic glutamate-R (e.g., mGluR). Intra-infusions of MPEP, a mGlu5-R antagonist, into the rat PLC disrupted spatial memory tested by a cross-maze and NOP memory test (Christoffersen et al., 2008). Infusion of 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline (CNQX), an AMPA/kainate-R antagonist, into the PLC/ILC region (the dorsal mPFC) had no effect when given before the learning trial of NOP (Barker and Warburton, 2011a). When CNQX was infused into the PLC/ILC, either before the second sample trial or before the test trial of the TOM test, disrupted memory. Alternatively, intra-PLC/ILC infusion of 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5), an NMDA-R antagonist, impaired TOM performance when applied before the second sample trial, but not before the test trial (Barker and Warburton, 2011a). In the OiP test, pre-sample microinjections of CNQX or AP5 into the mPFC interfered short-term (5 minutes) memory in rats. The same pre-sample PFC infusions of AP5 also impaired OiP memory tested 1 hour later, but not when given pre-test (Barker and Warburton, 2008).\\nThese findings indicate that the expression of NOP memory is dependent on the mGlu5-R, but not the AMPA/kainate-R, of the mPFC. The encoding/consolidation of TOM is dependent upon the medial prefrontal cortical AMPA/kainate- and NMDA-R, while AMPA/kainate-R, but not NMDA-R, are required for the retrieval of TOM. Both the PFC AMPA/kainate- and NMDA-R are indispensable for the encoding of specific object-location relationships, while NMDA-R engages in the learning and consolidation, but not recall, of OiP memory.\\nDAergic neurons in the brain largely originate from the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area, forming the nigrostriatal and mesocorticolimbic pathways, respectively. DA binds to a large family of G-protein coupled-R that can be classified into D1-like (D1- and D5-R; activate cyclic AMP production) and D2-like (D2-, D3 and D4-R; inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity). The interaction between the mPFC and midbrain DAergic systems plays a key role in the processing of NOP: A unilateral PFC lesion combined with a midbrain DAergic systems deficiency in the unilateral hemisphere, impaired NOP (90 min interval) if the lesions were in different hemispheres, but not when they were in the same hemisphere. The same disconnected lesions did not influence spatial working memory tested by a T-maze non-matching to place task (Chao et al., 2013). This implies that the midbrain DA interplays with the mPFC in the expression of NOP memory and that the communication between a non-lesioned side of the mPFC and midbrain DA systems is necessary for object memory. Interestingly, the rat with the unilateral DA deficiency also showed deficits in the TOM test, suggestive of a relationship between “time”, DA systems and PFC/hippocampus functions (Chao et al., 2013). Transcranial direct current stimulation onto the PFC also increased DA levels in the hippocampus and striatum, and NOP memory was thereby improved in spontaneous hypertensive rats (Leffa et al., 2016). In addition, DA levels were found to be elevated in the mPFC during the test trial of NOP memory in rats (McLean et al., 2017).\\nWhen administrated prior to the sample trial, microinjections into the mPFC of the DA D1/5-R agonist SKF81297 facilitated, and its antagonist SCH23390 disrupted, NOP memory tested 24 hours later (De Bundel et al., 2013; Nagai et al., 2007). Microinjections of SCH23390 into the PFC, but not into the hippocampus, also blocked the facilitating effects of systemic reboxetine, a norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor, on the performance of long-term NOP (De Bundel et al., 2013). Pre-sample prefrontal microinjections of SCH23390 did not impair the NOP memory tested 1 hour later (Savalli et al., 2015), although contrary results have also been reported (Clausen et al., 2011). Pre-sample infusions of SKF81297 into the PFC impaired short-term (1 hour) NOP (Pezze et al., 2015). In the OiP test, pre-sample infusions of SCH23390 or SKF83566, a DA D1-R antagonist, into the rat mPFC led to an impairment, tested 5 and 1 hour later. Pre-test infusions of SCH23390 into the PFC had no effect in the OiP (1 hour) memory (Savalli et al., 2015). The D1/5-R of the mPFC could bidirectionally regulate the encoding and/or consolidation of NOP memory, probably compatible with their inverted U-shape functions in the processing of working memory (Cools and D’Esposito, 2011). Together, the prefrontal cortical D1-R underlie the learning and/or consolidation, but not retrieval, of object-location relevant information.\\nPre-sample microinjections of the DA D2-R antagonist L-741.626 into the PFC dose-dependently disrupted short-term NOP (2 min interval), which is consistent with its effects with acute systemic administration (Watson et al., 2012). Pre-sample infusions of the D3-R antagonist S33084 into the rat PFC dose-dependently improved NOP (4 hours interval), supported by the findings when injected systemically (Watson et al., 2012). Thus, pharmacological blockage of the prefrontal cortical DA D2- and D3-R leads to NOP deficiency and facilitation, respectively.\\nMicroinjections of the D1-R antagonist SCH23390, the D2-R antagonist L-741.626 or the D3-R agonist 7-OH-DPAT into the PFC after the sample trial dose-dependently impaired NOP memory when tested 1 hour later (Papp et al., 2017). Conversely, post-sample microinjections of the D1-R agonist SKF81297, the D2-R agonist quinpirole or the D3-R antagonist SB277,011 into the PFC facilitated NOP memory when tested after 24 hours (Papp et al., 2017). However, a study shows that post-sample PFC infusions of quinpirole did not affect NOP performance (Rossato et al., 2013). Infusions of SCH23390 into the PFC also impaired long-term 24 hours NOP memory when administrated immediately, but not 6 hours, after the sample trial (Rossato et al., 2013). These results suggest that the prefrontal cortical DA D1-, D2- and D3-R critically modulate the NOP consolidation. Pharmacological blockage of DA D1- and D2-R and activation of D3-R disrupt short-term object consolidation, but pharmacological activation of DA D1- and D2-R and blockage of D3-R facilitate long-term object consolidation.\\nCollectively, DA plays a significant role in the regulation of the prefrontal cortical functions in the encoding and consolidation of NOP and OiP processing, irrespective of short- or long-term memory.\\nThe primary source of serotonin (5-HT) derives from the raphe nuclei that project to the central nervous systems. 5-HT, by executing its action through the binding to more than 14 types of 5-HT-R, have received emphasis in the modulation of PFC-related functions and memory processing (Meneses, 2015). For instance, the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor escitaplopram, but not citaplopram, facilitated the NOP memory, increased the neuronal firing rate of ventral tegmental area in vivo, and potentiated the mPFC NMDA-R mediated currents in vitro (Schilstrom et al., 2011).\\nPre-test microinjections of MDL 11,939, a 5-HT2A-R antagonist, into the rat mPFC impaired TOM, but not NOP and OPP, all with 3 hours intervals (Bekinschtein et al., 2013). In the object-in-context (OIC) test, different sets of objects are presented at distinct contexts and animals are later asked to recognize which object is incongruent to the testing context. Pre-test prefrontal infusions of MDL 11,939 or 8-OH DPAT, a 5HT1A-R agonist, but not of SB 242084, a 5HT2C-R antagonist, also impaired OIC memory tested 3 hours later (Bekinschtein et al., 2013). These findings suggest that 5HT2A-R in the mPFC are critical for memory retrieval in short-term TOM, but not for NOP and OPP. The prefrontal 5HT1A-R and 2A-R, but not 2C-R, are also important in the retrieval of short-term OIC memory.\\nLesion and inactivation studies have provided substantial evidence that TOM, OiP and episodic-like, but not NOP and OPP, memories are dependent on the mPFC. However, the mPFC may mediate memory consolidation, regardless of types of object exploration tests. Furthermore, pharmacological studies have found that NOP memory tested even minutes later was impaired by pre-sample infusions of substances into the PFC (Christoffersen et al., 2008; Pezze et al., 2015; Watson et al., 2012). Details of findings of substances injected locally into the mPFC are listed in Table 1. The results suggest that it may not be the mPFC is irrelevant to NOP processing, but rather other neural systems take over when the mPFC is dysfunctional.\\nEvidence has shown that the EC is involved in spatial recognition and long-term memory. EC-lesioned animals showed deficient spatial navigation in the Morris water maze (Nyakas et al., 2009; Parron et al., 2004), but not when spatial cues were provided by proximal objects located in the pool (Parron et al., 2004). The EC-lesioned rats have also been reported to show deficits in the NOP test with an 2-hour interval (Nyakas et al., 2009). Post-sample intra-EC infusions of the protein synthesis inhibitors, anisomycin, emetine or cycloheximide, disrupted long-term (24 hours), but not short-term (3 hours), NOP memory. This disruption was time-dependent as the effect was found when infusions were made immediately, but not 3 or 6 hours, after the sample (Lima et al., 2009). Thus, the EC participates in long-term memory consolidation of object memory. In the SNOP test, impaired spatial recognition and less object exploration were found in EC-lesioned animals (Parron and Save, 2004). The EC lesioned animals also exhibited deficits in habituation to the environment when the time delay was 10, but not 4 min. In addition, impaired spatial recognition, but not object recognition, was found, irrespective of the delays (Van Cauter et al., 2008a). This indicates that the EC is important for maintaining spatial information across time in memory storage. Furthermore, electrical stimulation of EC facilitated NOP memory and water maze spatial navigation in rats infused with the amyloid peptides 1–42 into the hippocampus, as a model of Alzheimer’s disease (Zhang et al., 2015), suggestive of close connections between the EC and hippocampus-dependent functions.\\nIn non-spatial (what) object exploration tests, lesions of the LEC of rats spared memory in the classic NOP test (Kuruvilla and Ainge, 2017; Van Cauter et al., 2013; Wilson et al., 2013b; Wilson et al., 2013c), but impaired object memory when 3 or 4 distinct objects were used during the learning (Hunsaker et al., 2013; Kuruvilla and Ainge, 2017). This finding is in agreement with others, indicating the LEC is critical for the memory of associations between different objects, even contexts (Hunsaker et al., 2013; Kuruvilla and Ainge, 2017; Wilson et al., 2013b; Wilson et al., 2013c). Evidence from the SNOP test has supported this perspective, as object recognition was compromised when four distinct, but not identical, objects were required to be remembered by LEC lesioned rats (Rodo et al., 2017; Van Cauter et al., 2013). When reducing the diversity of objects to three distinct objects, the LEC-lesioned animals were able to show intact object recognition in the SNOP test (Rodo et al., 2017). These results indicate that the LEC processes complicated, but not simple, inter-relationships between objects. Compatible with this view are the imaging findings that the LEC was more recruited in the processing of the number of items (5 versus 10 odors) during the recall of a non-matching to sample task (Ku et al., 2017). In contrast, MEC lesions affected neither the NOP test (Hales et al., 2014; Hales et al., 2018; Hunsaker et al., 2013; Kuruvilla and Ainge, 2017; Van Cauter et al., 2013) nor object novelty as assessed by the SNOP test (Rodo et al., 2017; Van Cauter et al., 2013). Pre-test microinjections of scopolamine into the MEC also had no effect in the NOP test, but decreased the amount of object exploration (Rashid and Ahmed, 2019). Thus, the LEC, but not MEC, critically processes object-object inter-relationships when environmental complexity (object associative information) increases.\\nIn an OPP-like paradigm to test spatial (where) object exploration, in which a single object was presented in the sample trial and another identical object was placed together with the familiar one in the test trial, memory was disrupted in animals with lesion of the MEC, but not LEC (Van Cauter et al., 2013). However, another study showed that lesions of the MEC did not disrupt memory in the OPP test, but impaired spatial memory tested by the water maze escape task and that combined lesions of the MEC and hippocampus led to a stronger impairment (Hales et al., 2014). In the SNOP test, impaired spatial recognition was found after lesion of the MEC (Rodo et al., 2017; Van Cauter et al., 2013). The MEC-lesioned animals exhibited deficits in spatial recognition when three or four distinct, but not identical, objects were used in the sample trial of the SNOP test (Rodo et al., 2017). These data illustrate the engagement of the MEC in the processing of “general” information about space and its interaction with the hippocampus (Hales et al., 2014; Hales et al., 2018), particularly in situation with increased complexity of objects. It should be noted that lesions of the MEC may mask its specific role in the processing of spatial information. For example, inactivation of the superficial layers of MEC stellate cells impaired memory for OPP, but not NOP, in mice (Tennant et al., 2018). Lesions of the LEC, on the other hand, did not affect OPP memory (Van Cauter et al., 2013; Wilson et al., 2013c), but impaired object-location recognition in a test in which two distinct objects were replaced by two identical ones, chosen from either of the explored type (Wilson et al., 2013c). Impaired spatial recognition was also reported in the LEC-lesioned rats tested by the SNOP paradigm (Van Cauter et al., 2013), but see (Rodo et al., 2017). In the same vein, the LEC-lesioned rats showed deficits in searching for foods in an arena in which spatial cues were provided by two distinct objects located within the environment (Kuruvilla and Ainge, 2017). Space-relevant object recognition can be mediated by both LEC and MEC, depending on the diversity of objects explored.\\nA summary of the roles of LEC and MEC in the object exploration tests is shown in Table 2 and Figure 3. Please note that less object exploration and habituation to the testing environment were sometimes reported in the mentioned studies (Parron and Save, 2004; Van Cauter et al., 2013; Van Cauter et al., 2008a), which could potentially confound the observed performance. Secondly, the majority of lesion studies has applied less than 10-minutes retention intervals (consequences are not clear after longer delays). The whole EC is likely to engage in long-term object memory, given that EC-lesioned or inactivated animals exhibited deficits in the NOP test when tested 24 hours later (Lima et al., 2009; Nyakas et al., 2009). How the LEC and MEC contribute to long-term memory in regards to spatial and non-spatial processing remains unclear.\\nThe role of the hippocampus in the processing of NOP is contentious. The hippocampus is not required for short-term NOP memory (less than 10 minutes) shown by lesion and inactivation studies (organized in Table 3). Inconsistent findings were reported in the literature when the retention delay was over 10 minutes in the NOP test. Some studies showed that rats with hippocampal lesions had impaired NOP (across delays from 10 minutes to 24 hours) memory (Ainge et al., 2006; Broadbent et al., 2010; Broadbent et al., 2004; Clark et al., 2000), whereas the majority of the studies employing hippocampal lesions in rats failed to report an influence in the NOP test (Albasser et al., 2012; Albasser et al., 2010; Barker and Warburton, 2011b; Forwood et al., 2005; Gaskin et al., 2003; Good et al., 2007a; Langston and Wood, 2010; Mumby et al., 2005; Piterkin et al., 2008; Tam et al., 2014; Winters et al., 2004). Alternatively, pre-sample intra-hippocampus infusions of lidocaine (Hammond et al., 2004) or muscimol (Cohen et al., 2013) was reported to disrupt NOP memory tested 24 hours later in mice. Similar effects were also found in a circular track in which animals explored newly and repeatedly presented objects in a clockwise order (Bass et al., 2014).\\nOn the other hand, the hippocampus is likely involved in NOP consolidation and/or retrieval. Hippocampal CA1 firing rates were enhanced during NOP testing (Cohen et al., 2013) and NOP consolidation is related to an increase of the hippocampal CA3-CA1 synaptic efficacy (Clarke et al., 2010). Both CA1 and CA3 areas (more CA1 than CA3) were recruited in the NOP test (Beer et al., 2013). In studies investigating retrograde memory, animals with hippocampus lesion, after being submitted to repeated exposure of the sample trial in the NOP test, exhibited impaired recognition memory when tested within 5, but not 8, weeks after the lesions (Broadbent et al., 2010; Gaskin et al., 2003; Haijima and Ichitani, 2012). Thus, an intact learning is not sufficient to support the memory if the hippocampus was damaged afterward. Post-sample intra-hippocampus infusion of muscimol impaired long-term NOP (24 hours) memory (Cohen et al., 2013; Haettig et al., 2011), but see (Oliveira et al., 2010). Interestingly, post-sample infusions of muscimol and the GABAa-R antagonist bicuculline into the dorsal hippocampus respectively facilitated and disrupted long-term NOP memory in a less-habituated environment, but not after sufficient habituation (Kim et al., 2014; Oliveira et al., 2010). This suggests that the dorsal hippocampal GABAa-R dually modulate NOP consolidation when contextual information is relatively novel. The ventral hippocampus is also involved in NOP memory, as muscimol infusions led to NOP deficits (Neugebauer et al., 2018), albeit this was not supported by a lesion study (Broadbent et al., 2004). Post-sample infusions of anisomycin into the hippocampal CA1 area impaired long-term (24 hours), but not short-term (3 hours), NOP memory when it was infused within 3, but not 6, hours after the sample trial (Rossato et al., 2007), whereas no effect was reported (Balderas et al., 2008). Similar results were found with intra-CA1 infusion of anisomycin, which impaired NOP consolidation and reconsolidation, and the reconsolidation effects of which were reversed by the ubiquitin-proteasome system inhibitor β-Lactacystin (Furini et al., 2015). Post-sample intra-CA1 infusions of lactacystin also disrupted long-term NOP memory, but in a time-dependent manner (Figueiredo et al., 2015). A recent study showed that chemogenetic inhibition (KORD), but not hM4Di, of the dorsal hippocampus impaired NOP consolidation tested 24 hours later (Tuscher et al., 2018). Pre-test muscimol microinjections into the dorsal hippocampus was reported to impair (Cohen et al., 2013; Stackman et al., 2016) or not affect (Haettig et al., 2011) NOP memory in mice.\\nIt has also been shown that the hippocampal neurogenesis is important for the existed object information (Suarez-Pereira and Carrion, 2015). The hippocampal dentate gyrus is involved in NOP processing as evidenced by destruction of high K+ infusions into the region leading to NOP deficits, either treated before or after the sample trial (Suzuki et al., 2015). NOP memory also elevated the AMPA/NMDA current ratio in the dentate gyrus (Yang et al., 2017). However, lesions in the dorsal dentate gyrus did not induce NOP/OPP deficits in rats (Beselia et al., 2010), and DREADD activation of GABAergic parvalbumin neurons in the dentate gyrus also showed no effect in the NOP test, but influenced anxiety-like behaviors, social novelty and contextual fear extinction in mice (Zou et al., 2016). Whether the dente gyrus engaging in object memory depends on situations when configurations of object-feature or -context were altered (Dees and Kesner, 2013; Kesner et al., 2016; Kesner et al., 2015).\\nThe hippocampus actively processes contextual cues. Rats with hippocampus lesions exhibited intact NOP tested in the same environment, but not in different one. However, opposite results were found if only local cues proximal to the applied objects were altered: The control animals had deficient NOP memory in the changed context, but intact memory in the same one, while the lesioned animals remembered the objects in both cases (Piterkin et al., 2008). This is consistent with a later study in which pre-test microinjection of muscimol into the dorsal hippocampus impaired NOP memory when encoded and recalled in different environments (Cohen et al., 2013). Thus, the hippocampus processes the information about located objects within a specific context.\\nTaken together, the hippocampus is not essential for NOP memory when the retention is less than 10 minutes. The hippocampus engagement in the processing of NOP memory over 10 minutes depends on many factors. Lesion extent of the hippocampus has been discussed, in that severe, but not partial, lesions influenced NOP memory (Broadbent et al., 2004). Yet, the effects of severe hippocampal lesions could be confounded by less object exploration during the NOP encoding (Ainge et al., 2006). Lesions of the hippocampus also influenced memory load, i.e., how many types and numbers of objects can be remembered. Studies have shown that the dorsal hippocampus-lesioned mice were impaired in remembering six distinct objects (Sannino et al., 2012), although this finding seems hard to explain the mentioned discrepancies because two identical objects are usually used in the NOP test (Table 3). Method of lesion (e.g., permanent versus transient lesions) can be a factor; in the majority of studies the non-effect of hippocampus lesions is likely to reflect a functional compensation, such as the reorganization of neuronal circuits in hippocampus-associated regions (Cohen and Stackman, 2015). However, a non-effect of pharmacological inactivation on the dorsal hippocampus was reported in the NOP test if animals were well-habituated to the testing environment (Kim et al., 2014; Oliveira et al., 2010). The majority of chemogenetic studies, either activated before or after the sample trial, showed no influence in the 24 hours-delayed NOP test by overall excitation or inhibition on the dorsal hippocampus, or selectively on the excitatory glutamatergic neurons or inhibitory interneurons in the region (Lopez et al., 2016; Tuscher et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018; Zou et al., 2016). Nevertheless, long-term NOP impairment was consistently found when the hippocampus was damaged after the learning session (Broadbent et al., 2010; Gaskin et al., 2003; Haijima and Ichitani, 2012). Thus, the hippocampus is undoubtedly important for NOP memory when the retention is over 10 minutes (Cohen and Stackman, 2015), while its involvement likely depends on contextual novelty (Kim et al., 2014; Oliveira et al., 2010; Yi et al., 2016), features of context (Piterkin et al., 2008), and probably allocentric signals (Langston and Wood, 2010) (see below).\\nThe OPP test has been shown to be hippocampus-dependent in rodents (Barker and Warburton, 2011b; Mumby et al., 2002). This is compatible with the classical consensus that the hippocampus is a critical brain region for processing spatial information. Electrophysiological recordings of the hippocampal CA1 cells have shown that when the location of two objects was rotated, the CA1 firing pattern remapped, suggesting that the CA1 coordinated the altered spatial information (Lenck-Santini et al., 2005). CA1 firing rate was also increased during the OPP test, especially when a novel object was placed at a new location (Larkin et al., 2014). CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons were reported to code object information in location when the objects were spatially displaced (Deshmukh and Knierim, 2013; Manns and Eichenbaum, 2009). CA1 area was required in both object and location conditions, while CA3 was more recruited for OPP than NOP (Beer et al., 2013). Likewise, the CA1 neuronal firing pattern was reorganized during the learning of searching for a new goal in a spatial memory task (Dupret et al., 2010). Higher c-fos expression induced by the OPP, but not NOP, test was found in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subregions (Mendez et al., 2015), while Arc mRNA imaging data showed higher involvement of CA3 in OPP than NOP (Beer et al., 2013). OPP memory also increased the expression of other immediate early genes, such as Arc, Zif268 and Narp, and enhanced the protein levels of Arc, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and αCaMKII in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (Soule et al., 2008). In addition, the newborn cells of dentate gyrus are critical for OPP memory (Jessberger et al., 2009). A study has reported that hippocampal lesioned rats showed intact memory when tested by a paradigm similar to OPP with a 2 min interval. Interestingly, in this OPP-like test in which two distinct objects were presented and only one of their kind was presented later, the rats with hippocampus lesions exhibited disrupted memory when placed into the testing arena from different starting locations, but not from the same location (Langston and Wood, 2010). This suggests that the hippocampus encodes allocentric information of located objects, which is compatible with the findings of the landmark-vector properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons (Deshmukh and Knierim, 2013). The dorsal, but not ventral, hippocampus has been shown to be critically involved in OPP memory (Gaskin et al., 2009a), leading to disrupted OPP memory tested 2 hours, but not 5 min, later (Tam et al., 2014). The functional separation of dorsal versus ventral hippocampus in the processing of memory could be associated with the dominant role of the dorsal hippocampus in both, encoding and retrieval processes (Nakamura and Sauvage, 2016).\\nMice with specific inactivation of the hippocampal excitatory or inhibitory neurons exhibited long-term OPP deficits, suggesting that both excitatory and inhibitory neurons are cardinal for this memory (Haettig et al., 2013). In line with these findings, application of DREADDs by transferring excitatory- (M3Dq)- or inhibitory- (M4Di)-R into the dorsal hippocampus, led to improved long-term memory for OPP, but not NOP, in the M3Dq-activated mice, while the M4Di-activated animals showed the opposite (Lopez et al., 2016). Deficits in OPP memory (4-hour inter-trial interval) were also found when the dorsal hippocampus was, either pre- or post-sample, chemogenetic inhibited (M4Di or KORD) in the ovariectomized female mice (Tuscher et al., 2018). Post-sample activation of M3Dq selectively in the CA1 interneurons also impaired long-term OPP, but not NOP, memory in mice (Yu et al., 2018). In a simultaneous assessment of mnemonic information processing for NOP versus OPP, rats with lesioned hippocampus showed the preference for novel object over novel location (Chao et al., 2016b). This result implies that information about object, but not location, can be functionally compensated when the hippocampus is damaged. Overall, it is clear that the hippocampus plays an important role in OPP memory, which can be mediated by the hippocampal excitatory and inhibitory neurons.\\nDistinct hippocampal subregions are activated by different object stimuli that combine “what” and “where” components. For instance, in a setting of exploring three small “positionally” distinct objects, the distal CA1 and proximal CA3, which preferentially receive “what” information (Mishkin et al., 1983), were recruited during the recognition of a novel object (increased mRNA of the immediate early genes Arc and Homer1a), whereas the proximal CA3 and lower blade of dentate gyrus, but not CA1, were involved in novel object recognition during exploring three large “directionally” distinct objects (Hoang et al., 2018). The neuronal plasticity of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) underlie object exploration processes. When encountering a novel environment, LTP was enhanced in the CA1, dentate gyrus and CA3 (Hagena and Manahan-Vaughan, 2011; Kemp and Manahan-Vaughan, 2008), suggesting that the cellular mechanism is common for such a situation. In the NOP test, LTD was facilitated in the CA1 (Goh and Manahan-Vaughan, 2013c). During “positional” object exploration, LTD was enhanced in the CA1 region, but not dentate gyrus, while the opposite results were found during “directional” object exploration (Kemp and Manahan-Vaughan, 2008). Interestingly, LTD was facilitated at the commissural-associational fibers in CA3 during the “positional” object exploration test, but not at the mossy fibers from the dentate gyrus projecting to the CA3. In the “directional” object exploration setting, the mossy fibers-CA3 LTD was facilitated, but not the commissural-CA3 LTD (Hagena and Manahan-Vaughan, 2011). Furthermore, fast gamma (~60–100 Hz) synchrony between CA1 and CA3 is found to increase during the encoding of novel object-place information (Zheng et al., 2016).\\nStudies on proteomes of hippocampal areas CA1 and CA3 were found to show a different level of expression for ~ 31% (532 proteins out of 1697 ones) after an open field exploration. In addition, memories for NOP and OPP explicitly altered CA1 and CA3 proteomes, in which the changes of protein expression were largely consistent in CA1 across the two forms of memory, but distinct in CA3. These results suggest that specialized proteomic roles of CA1 and CA3 areas contribute to recognition memory (von Ziegler et al., 2018).\\nThe memory for object-place associations requires the involvement of the hippocampus. Lesions or NMDA-R blockade in the hippocampus disrupt OiP memory (Barker et al., 2007; Barker and Warburton, 2015; Good et al., 2007a). Post-sample infusions of the DNMT inhibitor RG108 or 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine into the hippocampus impaired memory in the OiP, but not NOP, test, suggesting that hippocampal DNA methylation engages in the processing of object-place information (Scott et al., 2017).\\nIncreased zif-268 expression was found in the dorsal CA1 after exposure to the ELM2–2 paradigm in which rats showed intact where, but not when component (Barbosa et al., 2013). Rats with temporal lobe epilepsy induced by kainate treatment exhibited impaired episodic-like memory, assessed by the ELM2–2 test, along with disrupted theta coherence across the CA1 and dentate gyrus, but performance on tests of memory for what (NOP), where (OPP) or when (TOM) were not influenced (Inostroza et al., 2013b). In this epilepsy model, decreased theta-gamma (30–60 Hz) coupling in the hippocampal CA1 area was associated with the impaired episodic-like memory (Lopez-Pigozzi et al., 2016). In the ELM2–2 test, pre-sample intra-CA1 muscimol infusions disrupted the interaction as well as the where and when components (Drieskens et al., 2017). Importantly, CA3 lesioned rats exhibited intact NOP, TOM and spatial recognition memories, but were not capable of episodic-like memory in the ELM2–2 test, indicating that the CA3 region is critical for the integration of “what-where-when” components into an episodic-like memory (Li and Chao, 2008). Intra-CA3 infusion of lidocaine also impaired the performance of rats tested by a task of source memory, which is critical for identifying different episodes (Crystal et al., 2013). Distinct, but complementary, roles of differential hippocampal subregions and circuits are expected in the processing of episodic-like memory.\\nGlutamate plays an important role in hippocampal plasticity and object memory. For example, the extracellular glutamate content in the hippocampus was increased in the NOP test (Cohen et al., 2013; Stanley et al., 2012). NOP memory and hippocampal LTP were both impaired even several weeks later by a single systemic administration of MK-801, a NMDA-R blocker, in rats (Wiescholleck and Manahan-Vaughan, 2013). The enhanced hippocampal LTD induced by the learning of novel objects can be blocked by the systemic administrations of the NMDA-R antagonist CPP or mGlu5-R antagonist MPEP (Goh and Manahan-Vaughan, 2013a). In an earlier study, mice with selective NMDA-R subunit 1 knockout in the hippocampal CA1 area exhibited NOP deficits (Rampon et al., 2000).\\nPre-sample hippocampal infusions of AP5 disrupted NOP memory tested 3 hours, but not 5 minutes, later in rats (Baker and Kim, 2002). With manipulations of the number of objects used in the sample of the NOP test, pre-sample AP5 infusions into the hippocampus impaired memory when there were four, but not two, sample objects (Sugita et al., 2015). Pre-sample AP5 microinjections into the hippocampus impaired performance on OPP (Cassini et al., 2013), but not NOP (Barker and Warburton, 2015; Yamada et al., 2017). Pre-sample infusion of CNQX or AP5 into the rat postsubiculum also impaired long-term OPP, but not NOP, performance (Bett et al., 2013). Post-sample AP5 infusion into the hippocampus impaired OPP, while pre-test AP5 infusion had no influence, suggesting that the treatment influenced consolidation of information, but not retrieval processes (Yamada et al., 2017).\\nIn a study that the strength of encoding (exposure to the sample from 2 – 5 times) and delay between trials (24 hours - 6 weeks) were manipulated, pre-test infusions of AP5 into the hippocampus disrupted NOP performance only when the memory was weak, while infusion of 2,3-Dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX), a potent AMPA-R antagonist, impaired the memory irrespective of the delays (Iwamura et al., 2016). The above results suggest that the hippocampal AMPA- and NMDA-R are important for OPP memory, while whether they account for NOP performance depends on the extent of memory load.\\nNMDA-R GluN1 and GluN2A levels were elevated in the hippocampus, but not in the PFC, after habituation to an open field and exploration in the NOP sample trial, while they did not change after the NOP test (Cercato et al., 2017), suggesting their roles in novelty discrimination of an environment. Reduction of NMDA-R surface dynamics in the dorsal hippocampus had no effect in the long-term (24 hours) OPP test (Potier et al., 2016). Maintenance of long-term OPP memory required GluA2/AMPA-R stabilization, as evidenced by intra-hippocampus infusions of peptides that intervene in the binding process of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor to GluA2 (Migues et al., 2014). Likewise, post-sample hippocampal infusions of GluA23Y or G2CT that interfered with the GluA2/AMPA-R removal, reinstated the forgotten OPP long-term memory and did not influence new OPP learning (Migues et al., 2016). In the ELM2–1 test, selective knockout of the NMDA-R subunit NR1 in the hippocampal CA1 region impaired where, but not when, memory in mice. In contrast, mice with the same knockout, but in the CA3 region, exhibited intact where and when memory (Place et al., 2012). This suggests that the CA1 NMDA signaling is essential for the processing of spatial, but not temporal, information in an episodic-like context.\\nSimultaneous release of DA and NE was observed in the hippocampus during the OPP test, and catecholamine depletion in the dorsal hippocampus induced by 6-OHDA disrupted memory for OPP, but not NOP (Moreno-Castilla et al., 2017), indicating that hippocampal catecholaminergic neurotransmission has an active role in coding place of object.\\nIn the SNOP test, infusions of the DA D1/2-R agonist apomorphine into the hippocampal CA1, but not CA3, disrupted short-term 3-min recognition of object location. The same infusions of apomorphine into the CA1 or CA3 region did not affect the object novelty (Vago and Kesner, 2008). Likewise, pre-sample microinjections of SCH23390 or SKF38393 into the hippocampus did not influence NOP memory tested 90 min or 24 hours later (Balderas et al., 2013). Thus, the hippocampal DA D1/2-R are key for the performance of location novelty, but not object novelty.\\nPre-sample hippocampal infusion of the DA D1/5-R agonist SKF81297 improved long-term (24 hours interval) NOP memory (De Bundel et al., 2013), while that of SCH23390, a D1/5-R antagonist, impaired it (De Bundel et al., 2013). Pre-sample microinjections of SCH23390 into hippocampus did not affect OPP memory when tested 1 hour later (Savalli et al., 2015), but impaired long-term (24 hours) OPP memory (Moncada, 2017). The hippocampal DA D1/5-R mediate long-term NOP memory, while their roles in OPP memory are dependent on the extent of memory strength.\\nPost-sample trial microinjections of the D1-R antagonist SCH23390 and D3-R agonist 7-OH-DPAT, but not D2-R antagonist L-741.626, into the hippocampus impaired NOP when tested 1 hour later, whereas post-sample hippocampal infusions of SCH23390 had no effect on long-term NOP memory (Rossato et al., 2015; Rossato et al., 2013), although in another study an impairment by SCH23390 was reported (Furini et al., 2014). Post-sample microinjections of the D1-R agonist SKF81297, the D2-R agonist quinpirole and the D3-R antagonist SB277,011 into the dorsal hippocampus facilitated NOP when tested after 24 hours (Papp et al., 2017). Thus, the hippocampal DA D1-, D2- and D3-R are involved in NOP consolidation in a bidirectional manner, while D1-R showed variable effects.\\nIn experiments on memory reconsolidation, in which the second sample trial can be considered as the test trial for NOP, pre-test infusions of SCH23390 into the dorsal hippocampal CA1 area showed no effects on long-term NOP memory (Rossato et al., 2015).\\nPost-sample, but not pre-sample or pre-test, infusions of TCB-2, a 5-HT2A-R agonist, into the dorsal hippocampal CA1 improved NOP when tested 24 hours later in mice. TCB-2 also enhanced the hippocampal glutamate levels and the mean firing rate of CA1 neurons (Zhang et al., 2016). The NOP-facilitating effect of the 5-HT1B-R agonist CP94253 in 5-HT1B-R adapter protein p11 knockout mice was prevented by overexpression of p11 selectively in the hippocampus (Eriksson et al., 2013). Post-sample infusions of RS67333, a 5-HT4-R agonist, or RS23597, a 5-HT4-R antagonist, into the dorsal CA1 area impaired spatial recognition tested by the SNOP paradigm (Nasehi et al., 2017).\\nPre-sample infusions of nicotine into the dorsal hippocampus facilitated long-term NOP and OPP memories when tested 72 hours later in rats (Melichercik et al., 2012). Post-sample microinjections of scopolamine into the hippocampus disrupted NOP memory after 90 min, but not 24 hours; long-term NOP memory was also not influenced when the injection was made 160 min after the sample trial or 90 min before the test trial (Balderas et al., 2012). Pre-test infusions of scopolamine into the dorsal CA1 area did not affect NOP memory, but reduced the overall object exploration time (Rashid and Ahmed, 2019). The hippocampal ACh-R play key roles in memory consolidation, with nicotinic and muscarinic ACh-R being related to facilitation and disruption of mnemonic storage, respectively.\\nThe interaction between cholinergic and NMDA systems contributes to memory. In cultured hippocampal neurons, for example, co-application of choline and NMDA/glycine caused larger currents than the application of NMDA/glycine alone; choline enhanced NMDA-R-mediated LTP of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC). Intervention with the interaction between the nicotinic α7 ACh-R and NMDA-R blocked these effects in vitro, and disrupted NOP memory in mice (Li et al., 2013). Application of the nicotinic α7 ACh-R agonist FRM-17874 facilitated NOP in rats and dose-dependently enhanced the theta oscillation induced by electrical stimulation in the rodent hippocampus (Stoiljkovic et al., 2015).\\nThe tuberomammillary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus, the origin of histaminergic neurons, projects axons to wide areas of the brain; e.g. histamine H1-, H2- and H3-R are found in the cortex, hippocampus and amygdala (Esbenshade et al., 2008; Panula et al., 1984; Ryu et al., 1995; Watanabe et al., 1984). In histamine H1-R and H2-R knockout mice, LTP in the hippocampus CA1 area was decreased together with impairment of NOP memory (Dai et al., 2007).\\nThe hippocampal histamine-R play a critical role in object memory consolidation: Post-sample infusions of the histamine H1-R antagonist pyrilamine, the H2-R antagonist ranitidine or the H3-R agonist imetit into the hippocampal CA1 area impaired long-term NOP memory (24 hours) when infused 30 min or 2 hours later, but not when applied immediately or 6 hours later (da Silveira et al., 2013). Conversely, the histamine H1-R agonist pyridylethylamine, the H2-R agonist dimaprit and the H3-R antagonist thioperamide had no effect on NOP consolidation when infused into the CA1 (da Silveira et al., 2013).\\nThe rat hippocampal NE levels were found to increase after object exploration (Mello-Carpes et al., 2016). Post-sample infusions of the β-adrenergic antagonist timolol into the hippocampal CA1 area disrupted long-term NOP memory in rats (Furini et al., 2010; Mello-Carpes et al., 2016; Mello-Carpes and Izquierdo, 2013). Interestingly, intra-CA1 infusions of NE reversed the long-term NOP memory impairment induced by infusions of muscimol into the locus coeruleus (Mello-Carpes and Izquierdo, 2013). Post-sample infusions of NE into the rat CA1 region also promoted NOP memory tested 21 days later (Mello-Carpes et al., 2016). Thus, NE systems in the hippocampal CA1 control long-term NOP consolidation.\\nThe endocannabinoid system critically mediates development, synaptic plasticity, cognition and neuropsychiatric disorders through cannabinoid-R, endocannabinoids and the enzymes regulating the synthesis and degradation of the endocannabinoids. The G-protein-coupled cannabinoid 1-R is enriched in axonal terminals in the brain, while cannabinoid 2-R is mainly, but not exclusively, expressed in the periphery system (Lu and Mackie, 2016; Lutz et al., 2015). Application of JWH-018, a synthetic cannabinoid 1/2-R agonist, decreased potassium-evoked glutamate and GABA release and LTP in hippocampus slices (Barbieri et al., 2016; Basavarajappa and Subbanna, 2014). Mice with selective knockout of cannabinoid 1-R in the GABAergic neurons, exhibited disruption of NOP (30 min) memory, and facilitation of spontaneous IPSC in the CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro (Albayram et al., 2016). Furthermore, knockdown of the cannabinoid 1-R-interacting protein 1 in the mouse hippocampus increased cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus and improved NOP memory (Jung et al., 2017).\\nIntra-hippocampus infusions of WIN 55,212–2, a non-selective cannabinoid-R agonist, dose-dependently disrupted the performance in the OPP, but not NOP, test in rats (Suenaga and Ichitani, 2008). Post-sample infusions of WIN 55,212–2 or VDM-11, an endocannabinoid membrane transporter inhibitor, into the hippocampal CA1 region impaired long-term, but not short-term, NOP memory in a dose-dependent manner. Similar effects were found by the CA1 infusion of the cannabinoid 1-R agonist ACEA, but not the cannabinoid 2-R agonist JWH-015 or palmitoylethanolamide, an endogenous fatty acid amide with affinity to cannabinoid-R GPR55 and GPR119, suggesting a role of hippocampal cannabinoid 1-R in NOP consolidation (Clarke et al., 2008). Microinjections of the cannabinoid 1-R antagonist AM251 into the CA1 region facilitated object novelty tested by the SNOP paradigm (Nasehi et al., 2017).\\nThe cannabinoid 1-R in the hippocampus play distinct roles in the modulation of NOP and OPP memory, as evidenced by memory being impaired and improved through pharmacological activation and blockage of the R, respectively.\\nMany molecular pathways within the hippocampus are involved in object memory. For instance, inhibition of d-amino acid oxidase through d-serine modulation, augmented NMDA-R-mediated long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus ex vivo and improved long-term NOP memory in vivo (Hopkins et al., 2013). Intra-hippocampal infusions of rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR signaling, either pre- or post-sample, impaired NOP memory tested 24 hours later, suggesting that mTOR mechanisms in the hippocampus are underlying long-term object memory (Jobim et al., 2012), compatible with previous findings (Myskiw et al., 2008). Intra-hippocampal infusions of PD98059, a selective MEK inhibitor, disrupted long-term NOP memory in mice (Nagai et al., 2007). The RGS14 gene knockout mouse exhibited improved NOP memory and facilitation of LTP in the CA2, but not CA1, area. This effect is dependent upon the ERK/MAPK pathways, given that facilitated LTP in the CA2 was blocked by U0126, a MEK inhibitor (Lee et al., 2010). Expression of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and the immediate-early gene zif268 were increased after object exploration, and post-trial intra-hippocampal inhibition of NF-kB or zif268 impaired NOP memory (Zalcman et al., 2015). Object exploration also increased the expression of the immediate-early genes Nr4a1 and Nr4a2, while intra-hippocampal knockdown of either one impaired long-term OPP (24 hours) memory (McNulty et al., 2012). Post-sample infusions of zeta inhibitory peptide into the rat hippocampus impaired NOP memory (Hales et al., 2015). Intra-hippocampus injection of the AAV vector carrying either a negative or active form of Rac1, facilitated and impaired NOP memory, respectively, suggesting that Rac1 activity in the hippocampus dually controls NOP memory (Liu et al., 2016). Inactivating the atypical protein kinase C isoform M zeta (PKMζ) in the dorsal hippocampus abolished memory for OPP, but not NOP (Hardt et al., 2010); these effects were regulated by glutamate subunit 2-dependent AMPA-R (Migues et al., 2010).\\nObject exploration elevated the rat hippocampal BDNF levels (Furini et al., 2010; Mello-Carpes et al., 2016), and selective BDNF deletion in the mouse hippocampus disrupted NOP memory (Heldt et al., 2007). Post-sample intra-hippocampus BDNF infusions were found to compensate OPP deficits induced by anisomycin, and hippocampal BDNF infusions facilitated long-term OPP memory (Ozawa et al., 2014), suggesting hippocampal BDNF is involved in protein synthesis for spatial memory consolidation. Increased expression of BDNF in the hippocampal CA1 with the transduction of AAV9-BDNF, elevated the phosphorylation level of CaMKII, CREB, tropomyosin receptor kinase (TrkB) and p38 MAPK, and facilitated long-term OPP, but not NOP, memory (Wang et al., 2017b). Thus, BDNF signaling pathway in the hippocampus mediates NOP and OPP memory.\\nPost-sample hippocampal infusions of histone acetylase inhibitors decreased histone acetylation and impaired NOP memory (Federman et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2012), while the infusion of a HDAC inhibitor had the opposite effects (Federman et al., 2013). Longer learning of the sample trial of the NOP test increased hippocampal histone H3 acetylation and persistence of NOP memory, which could be prevented by NF-kB inhibition (Federman et al., 2013). OPP memory was enhanced by post-sample microinjections of the HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate into the dorsal hippocampus (Roozendaal et al., 2010). HDAC3-flox mice injected with AAV-Cre recombinase into the hippocampal CA1 region to selectively deplete HDAC3 in CA1, showed enhanced long-term OPP memory. Similar results were found in mice with the intra-CA1 infusions of RGFP136, a selective HDAC3 inhibitor (McQuown et al., 2011). The deacetylase domain of HDAC3 in the hippocampus was also found to be critical for long-term OPP memory in mice (Alaghband et al., 2017). Disrupted long-term OPP, but not NOP, memory, along with impaired hippocampal LTP and reduced histone H2B, H3 and H4 acetylation, were found in the CREB-binding protein-flox mice microinjected with AAV-Cre into the dorsal hippocampus to produce hippocampal CREB-binding protein depletion (Barrett et al., 2011).\\nAlthough the involvement of hippocampus in the NOP test is controversial (see 3.3.1), the hippocampus is essential for the processing of long-term NOP consolidation and retrieval. In addition, the hippocampus cardinally regulates the processing of OPP, OiP and episodic-like memories. Distinct neurotransmitter systems in the hippocampus have complementary and interactive roles in the regulation of different object exploration tests. The hippocampal DA, ACh and NE bi-directionally modulate NOP and OPP memories, while glutamate, 5-HT, histamine and cannabinoids are also engaged. The functions of hippocampal neurotransmitter systems are governed by different subtypes of receptors. Details of findings of substances injected locally into the hippocampus (points 3.3.5–11) are listed in Table 4.\\nThe indirect communication between the PFC and hippocampus was via other substrates to form many multi-synaptic routes. The nucleus reuniens (NR) in the medial thalamus, the perirhinal cortex and LEC are mutually connected with the PFC and hippocampus (Apergis-Schoute et al., 2006; Burwell and Amaral, 1998a; Hoover and Vertes, 2007; Varela et al., 2014). Anatomical interconnections are also found among the NR, perirhinal cortex and LEC (Burwell and Amaral, 1998a, b; Varela et al., 2014). Besides these regions, other neural substrates that project to both mPFC and hippocampus include the amygdala, ventral tegmental area, MSDB, and hypothalamus (Hoover and Vertes, 2007; Varela et al., 2014). DA and ACh neurotransmission play critical roles in the regulation of memory via the ventral tegmental area and MSDB projections to the PFC-hippocampus-associated circuits (Hasselmo, 2006; Lisman and Grace, 2005). Importantly, a subpopulation of single NR and LEC neurons sends axonal collaterals to both mPFC and hippocampus, implicating that the NR and LEC can directly and simultaneously modulate the activities of mPFC and hippocampus (Hoover and Vertes, 2012; Varela et al., 2014). The inhibitory projections from the LEC, but not MEC (since the projections are sparse (Melzer et al., 2012), to the hippocampal CA1 area form a disinhibition mechanism which blunts NOP processing (Basu et al., 2016). Thus, the indirect PFC-hippocampus pathway could engage in the functions required for the interaction between PFC and hippocampus. For example, the PFC-NR circuit is proposed to modulate memory generalization versus specification, at least in hippocampus-dependent contextual fear memory (Xu and Sudhof, 2013). The interplay between the mPFC and medial thalamus is also critical for TOM and OiP, but not NOP, tests (Cross et al., 2012). Electrical stimulation of the EC has been found to reduce PFC pyramidal cellular activity (Valenti and Grace, 2009), and to enhance neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (Stone et al., 2011). Brain activities, measured by fMRI, were increased in the rat mPFC and hippocampus by 5–20 Hz electrical stimulation of the LEC (Krautwald et al., 2019). Imaging studies have also indicated that the LEC-CA1 pathway is recruited for the processing of exploration of familiar objects and of object-recency, while the pathway of LEC-dentate gyrus-CA3 is activated for the processing of recognition of novel objects and for object-recency (Aggleton et al., 2012; Kinnavane et al., 2014; Olarte-Sanchez et al., 2014). Evidence also shows increased functional connectivity of hippocampal CA1, CA3, insular cortex, perirhinal cortex and mPFC formed by the NOP test (Tanimizu et al., 2018). The interaction between the mPFC and LEC is crucially involved in episodic-like memory in rats (Chao et al., 2016a). While the direct PFC-hippocampal and indirect PFC-NR/perirhinal/LEC-hippocampal pathways form anatomical loops for memory, the functional distinctions between the direct and indirect pathways are elusive, particularly in the context of episodic memory.\\nThe application of disconnection procedures together with behavioral tests has proven useful in exploring the causality of the mPFC-hippocampus interaction in the control of episodic memory. The basic proposition of the disconnection approach is that, if two brain areas interact for a specific function, disrupting one of the areas in one hemisphere combined with a simultaneous disruption of the other area in the opposite hemisphere (i.e. disconnecting the circuit at two different levels) should lead to a functional deficit. Disconnecting the PFC-hippocampus pathway did not influence performance in NOP and OPP tests, either by lesions (Barker and Warburton, 2011b) or infusions of NBQX or AP5 before the sample trial (Barker and Warburton, 2015). However, disconnection of the PFC and hippocampus disrupted TOM and OiP (remembrance for altering relative object-location associations) memories (Barker and Warburton, 2011b). Disconnected inactivation of the mPFC and hippocampus with pre-sample NBQX or AP5 infusions impaired OiP performance, independent of time delay. Retrieval of OiP memory was dependent on the PFC-hippocampus AMPA-R, but not NMDA-R (Barker and Warburton, 2015). Furthermore, pre-test infusions of NBQX into the unilateral PFC and hippocampus with the disconnection approach impaired the where and when components of the ELM4–2 test (Barker et al., 2017). These findings suggest that the interplay between the PFC and hippocampus is critical for “when” and “what-where-when” memories.\\nThe question that follows is whether the PFC-hippocampus pathway directly contributes to episodic memory per se or merely to the individual memory systems for what, where or when memory, given that, by logic, an impairment of one of the components should cause a failure of episodic memory. To investigate this issue, we conducted an episodic-like memory test along with separate tests for the components “what”, “where” and “when” in the same animals. The mPFC and dorsal hippocampus CA1 or CA3 regions were disconnected by employing the ELM2–2 test (For details see (Chao et al., 2017; de Souza Silva et al., 2016). When the PFC-CA1 circuit was interrupted, the ability to integrate distinct components into an episodic-like memory was impaired. Furthermore, performance in the OPP test (where) was disrupted, whereas memories for NOP (what) and TOM (when), were intact. The disruption of episodic-like memory could not have resulted from the impairment of object location memory since the PFC-CA1 disconnected animals showed intact spatial recognition in the ELM2–2 test (positive where index). This argues that they were not incapable of recognizing different locations. These findings indicate that the PFC-CA1 circuit is critically involved in the processing of episodic-like memory itself (Chao et al., 2017). By contrast, disconnecting the PFC-CA3 circuit also impaired performance in the ELM2–2 test, but did not interfere with performance in the individual NOP, OPP and TOM tests. Pharmacological inactivation of the PFC in one hemisphere with CNQX, but not with AP-5, combined with lesions of CA3 in the opposite hemisphere (disconnecting the CA3 and PFC gultamatergic circuit) disrupted episodic-like memory (de Souza Silva et al., 2016).\\nThe indirect PFC-hippocampus pathway also plays an important role in the processing of episodic-like memory. For instance, the NR mutually connects with the PFC and hippocampus and has been proposed to have an active role in the processing of memory. The NR-lesioned rats exhibited intact NOP, OPP and short-term OiP memories, but long-term OiP memory was impaired. Furthermore, the muscarinic and nicotine ACh-R, but not NMDA-R, of the NR can modulate the encoding of OiP memory (Barker and Warburton, 2018). Alternatively, the LEC, which is essential for object-associations (Wilson et al., 2013c), projects mutually to the CA1, CA3 and PFC. In order to test whether the indirect pathway is causally involved in episodic-like memory, the PFC-LEC circuit was disconnected (Chao et al., 2016a). As expected, memory tested by the ELM2–2 test was deficient, suggesting the PFC-LEC circuit is indispensable for episodic-like memory. This pathway is also engaged in the processing of object-associated identity, location and context information, but not in NOP, OPP and TOM (Chao et al., 2016a).\\nAttempts to dissect functions of differential neuronal circuits are progressing with the development of advanced biological tools, such as chemo- and opto-genetics. Barker et al. (2017) selectively inactivated the circuits from the posterior-dorsal or intermediate CA1 projecting to the mPFC in rats. In the ELM4–2 test, inactivation of the posterior-dorsal CA1 to PFC pathway impaired the when, but not where, component of episodic-like memory, while inactivation of the intermediate CA1-PFC pathway disrupted the where, but not when, component. Furthermore, the posterior-dorsal CA1 to PFC pathway was crucial for the memory for temporal-order, but not for NOP, OPP and OiP. In contrast, the intermediate CA1 to PFC pathway was important for OiP memory, but not for NOP, OPP and temporal-order. The findings pinpoint that the CA1 projection to PFC pathway is functionally divergent, with the posterior-dorsal and intermediate circuits accounting for the processing of temporal and inter-item locational information, accordingly (Barker et al., 2017).\\nEpisodic-like memory has been investigated and characterized as a prototype of episodic memory in the fields of behavioral neuroscience, psychopharmacology and cognitive psychology. The training-free episodic-like memory tests exploit the spontaneous object exploration which is shown by many species as behavioral measures, and thus, avoid using strong positive and negative reinforcements and extensive training procedures. These paradigms combine the properties of the NOP, OPP and TOM tests in the attempt to decipher the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie episodic-like memory. The direct and indirect pathways between the mPFC and hippocampus employ distinct, but complementary, functions to structure the “what”, “where” and “when” components that subserve episodic memory. Moreover, different neurotransmitter systems within the mPFC and hippocampus behave synergistically during the learning, storage and retrieval processes inherent in the NOP, OPP and TOM tests. The anatomical and functional connections between the mPFC, LEC and hippocampus inclusively, but not exclusively, underpin the formation of episodic-like memory. A meta-system of episodic-like memory which integrates the “what”, “where” and “when” component memories likely comprises the hippocampal CA1/CA3-prefrontal cortical circuitry.\\n']"

       "'Deducing biological function often relies on interpreting the effects of gene knockouts or targeted mutations reducing catalytic activity of enzymes. In the case of RNA-modifying enzymes with multiple substrates, it is unclear how to assign mutant phenotypes to loss of modification in specific RNA species. For instance, the NOP/Sun2RNA methyltransferase family member 2 (NSUN2) targets the majority of nuclear-encoded tRNAs, but also other cRNAs and ncRNAs [78,88]. A genetic knock-out in mice caused a variety of phenotypes ranging from impaired cellular differentiation to sex-specific infertility [89,90], while human individuals with congenital mutations in a splice-acceptor site of the NSUN2 gene display pleiotropic phenotypes defined by intellectual disability and skin differentiation defects [91,92]. Which methylation site(s) in which RNA substrate(s) cause(s) these phenotypes? While NSUN2 is a robust tRNA methyltransferase on (many) tRNAs, it is unclear which non-modified tRNA species or if any other RNA substrate contributes to the observed pleiotropy of mutant phenotypes. Also, loss of inosines from the transcriptome results in pleiotropic effects. In mammals, adenosines are deaminated to inosines by ADAR1 or ADAR2 [93]. Inosines are interpreted as guanosines during splicing or translation. Most interestingly, ADAR1 and ADAR2 have partially overlapping and distinct substrate specificities [94–96], while loss-of-function phenotypes of both enzymes differ considerably. ADAR2 deletion causes early post-natal lethality in mice, which can be rescued by genomic replacement of a single A-to-G in the Gria2 gene mimicking an abundant editing event at the corresponding site in the mRNA [97]. By contrast, ADAR1-deficient mice die during embryogenesis but can be rescued by deletion of viral RNA sensors, indicating that the presence of inosines in cellular RNAs is required to suppress the activation of innate immunity sensors [98–100]. Interestingly, inosines introduced by ADAR2 are either numerically insufficient or are wrongly placed to effectively suppress innate immune signalling. Furthermore, rescue of ADAR2 deficiency by a ‘pre-edited’ Gria2 allele raises the question as to the functional significance of the many other ADAR2 sites in coding regions, the elucidation of which may require further experimentation beyond the observation of loss-of-function phenotypes under standard laboratory conditions. Similar considerations apply to any multi-substrate RNA modification system, which presents an important conceptual challenge when interpreting RNA modification system mutant phenotypes.\\n'"
