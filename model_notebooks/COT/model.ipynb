The BCR protein can also be phosphorylated by BCR-ABL1 in the part derived from the first exon [ 154 ]. The phosphorylation of Tyrosine 177 of BCR by FPS/FES protein tyrosine kinases leads to the binding of Grb2, an activator of Ras [ 223 ]. This interaction is important for p190 BCR-ABL1 leukaemogenesis through GAB2-SHP2 signalling [ 224 ].
