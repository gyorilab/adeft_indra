We demonstrate that there are NK cells in the various FRT tissues and that their phenotype and regulation are largely dependent upon the FRT tissue where they reside. NK cells in the Fallopian tube, endometrium, cervix, and ectocervix expressed CD9 while blood NK cells did not. We have also found that unique subsets of NK cells are in specific locations of the FRT. The NK cells in the lower reproductive tract did not express CD94, but they did express CD16. In contrast, NK cells in the upper FRT express high amounts of CD94 and CD69, but few NK cells expressed CD16. All of these FRT NK cells were able to produce IFN-gamma upon stimulation with cytokines. Furthermore, the number of NK cells varied with the menstrual cycle in the endometrium but not in the cervix or ectocervix. These data suggest that unique characteristics of the tissues may account of specific localization of different NK cell subsets.\\n',\n",

       "('Interestingly, this potent kinase signaling pathway that regulates oocyte maturation is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. At the top of the cascade is MOS, an oocyte-specific mitogen-activated protein kinase (Mek) kinase similar to Raf ( Fig. 1 ).  Mos  mRNA is present in immature oocytes, but essentially none is translated into stable MOS protein. Steroid-triggered reductions in cAMP lead to increased polyadenylation of  Mos  mRNA in a process that involves interactions of regulatory proteins EG2 and cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB) with the 3′ untranslated region of  Mos  mRNA [ 21 – 26 ]. Increased polyadenylation of  Mos  mRNA leads to increased MOS protein expression. Once present, MOS protein is constitutively active and activates Mek1 [ 27 ], which in turn activates extracellular signaling-regulated kinase 2 (Erk2, or p42), and finally cycle-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). Activated Erk2 then feeds back to promote further increases in MOS protein expression and activity, thus markedly enhancing the signaling cascade in a feed-forward fashion [ 28 – 30 ].\\nWhile this unusual positive feedback loop was originally described in the 1960s and 1970s [ 10 ,  31 – 33 ], the description of regulatory factors that mediate this signaling pathway did not occur until nearly 30 years later, when paxillin was discovered to be an important component of steroid-triggered oocyte maturation. In retrospect, an association of paxillin with oocyte maturation makes sense, as, in somatic cells, paxillin is known to interact with and regulate the activity of several components of the MAPK signaling cascade, including Raf, MEK, and Erk [ 6 ,  34 ]. Since the same MOS/Mek/Erk pathway is crucial for steroid-triggered oocyte maturation, one might anticipate that paxillin would be involved. In fact, knockdown of paxillin expression in  Xenopus laevis  oocytes using either antisense oligonucleotides or siRNA almost completely abrogates androgen-induced maturation [ 35 ]. In addition, paxillin knockdown markedly attenuates androgen-triggered MOS protein expression and downstream Erk activation. In contrast, androgen-triggered polyadenylation of mRNA is unaffected by paxillin knockdown. Together, these results demonstrate that paxillin functions downstream of  Mos  mRNA modification and upstream of MOS translation to regulate nongenomic androgen-triggered oocyte maturation in  Xenopus laevis  oocytes ( Fig. 1 ).\\nSurprisingly, in addition to this important upstream role in regulating activation of the MOS/Mek/Erk pathway, paxillin is also regulating important maturation-related processes downstream of the MAPK pathway. As mentioned earlier, paxillin contains serine residues that are targets for Erk-dependent phosphorylation. Interestingly, while re-expression of wild-type paxillin rescues steroid-triggered maturation in paxillin-knockdown oocytes, rescue with a paxillin protein containing alanine substitutions on serine residues 107 and 111 is ineffective at rescuing maturation. MOS and Erk activation are still intact in the presence of this mutated paxillin, though at significantly lower levels [ 35 ]. These data, plus others, suggest that paxillin subserves two separate functions doing androgen-triggered oocyte maturation. First, it regulates activation of the MAPK pathway, most likely by upregulating MOS protein expression and then possibly serving as a scaffold for Mek and Erk signaling. Second, after Erk-dependent phosphorylation on serine residues, phosphoserine-paxillin regulates downstream processes that are still not yet known to regulate oocyte maturation. In fact, since MOS expression and Erk activation are slightly reduced in the absence of phosphoserine-paxillin, it is possible that one of the functions of phosphoserine-paxillin is to enhance the aforementioned positive feedback loop in MAPK signaling that is critical for normal oocyte maturation ( Fig. 1 ). Further studies will help elucidate how paxillin functions to both enhance MOS protein expression and promote downstream signals necessary for oocyte maturation; however, as seen below, the concept that paxillin and phosphoserine-paxillin play different but equally important roles in MAPK-mediated processes is a theme that is conserved from frog oocytes to human somatic cells.\\nWhat is the androgen-triggered nongenomic pathway that regulates prostate cancer cell growth? Similar to androgen-induced oocyte maturation, Erk signaling appears to be of major importance [ 37 ]. However, whereas androgens trigger Erk activation by up-regulating  Mos  mRNA polyadenylation and therefore MOS protein expression in frog oocytes, in prostate cancer cells, androgens bind to extranuclear ARs at or near the plasma membrane, leading to activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that then cleave membrane-bound epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands ( Fig. 2a ). These ligands then  trans -activate the EGFR, leading to Akt and Erk signaling [ 37 – 39 ]. Notably this concept of growth factor receptor  trans -activation is not unique, as the estrogen receptor is known to function similarly in many cell types, including breast cancer and endothelial cells [ 40 ,  41 ]. Thus, whether referring to extranuclear androgen signaling prostate cancer cells or extranuclear estrogen signaling in breast cancer cells, an important concept to be taken from both examples is that steroid-triggered kinase signaling is essentially the same as EGF-triggered kinase signaling, only steroids indirectly activate the EGFR through released EGFR ligands, while EGF directly activates the EGFR. In other words, outside the nucleus steroids signal just like a growth factor [ 37 ,  42 ].\\nOnce the EGFR has been activated by androgens in prostate cancer cells, Erk activation occurs via the well-established MAPK pathway that involves Raf-Mek-Erk. Notably, this is the same MAPK pathway described above in  Xenopus  oocytes, only, in germ cells, MOS replaces Raf at the top of the pathway ( Fig. 2a ). Thus, although different means are used in oocytes versus prostate cancer cells, the end result of extranuclear androgen-triggered signaling is ultimately the same: activation of the Raf/MOS-Mek-Erk pathway. As such, the expectation might be that paxillin regulates MAPK signaling in prostate cancer cells similarly to how it does so in  Xenopus  oocytes. In fact, paxillin indeed functions at the same locations in the MAPK signaling cascade in oocytes and somatic cells [ 37 ,  42 ]. First, paxillin is required for Raf activation. Activated EGFR stimulates Src, which then phosphorylates paxillin on tyrosine residue 31 and 118—a process necessary for Raf activation and subsequent Erk phosphorylation. In support of this pathway, siRNA-mediated paxillin knockdown in prostate cancer cells eliminates androgen-triggered Mek and Erk signaling, but not activation of the EGFR or the Src. Furthermore, Erk activation can be rescued by over-expression of constitutively activated Mek or Raf. Together, these results place paxillin actions just downstream of Src and upstream of Raf.\\nPaxillin mediates androgen-triggered  Xenopus laevis  oocyte maturation. Oocytes are held in meiotic arrest through constitutive Gαs- and Gβγ-mediated cAMP production, perhaps in part due to constitutive GPR3 activation at the membrane. Upon exposure to androgens, the androgen receptor (AR) complexes with G proteins to attenuate their signaling, thus reducing cAMP production. Decreased cAMP then leads to increased polyadenylation of existing  Mos  mRNA, followed by increased translation of MOS protein. MOS is a constitutively activated homologue of Raf (a MAPK kinase kinase) that then promotes Mek activation, followed by Erk2 activation. Erk2 then mediates phosphorylation of paxillin on serine residues, which is required for subsequent maturation. In addition, Erk2-dependent serine phosphorylation of paxillin appears to be necessary for maximal MOS protein production, suggesting that paxillin might be playing a role in the feed-forward MAPK kinase loop that is essential for normal meiotic progression\\n',\n",
