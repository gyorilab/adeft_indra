TEISSEIRE, LILIANE J. TEISSEIRE  and\\nROBERT A. HERIGAULT  Service de Physiologie et d\\'Explorations\\nFonctionnelles, and 1NSERM U. 138, Hdpital Henri Mondor,  94010\\nCreteil, France  Abstract. In anaesthetized guinea pigs, ventilated\\nwith ambient air, the peripheral haemodynamics and  oxygen transport\\ncharacteristics have been studied following a blood exchange\\ntransfusion with rat  erytrocytes suspended in guinea pig plasma.\\nSince the rat haemoglobin exhibited a lower oxygen affinity  than\\nguinea pig haemoglobin, the oxygen partial pressure at 50% of oxygen\\nhaemoglobin saturation  (Ps0) increased from 25.2 _+ 1.1 to 37.2 _+\\n0.9 mm Hg (n = 10). This increase in Ps0 was accompanied  by a\\nsignificant increase in arterial oxygen partial pressure (Pao2) and in\\narterio-venous difference  (AVDo2). Cardiac output (0) was decreased\\nsignificantly, but oxygen consumption (~\\'o2) remained  within control\\nvalues. The increase in Ps0 was associated with a venous oxygen\\npartial pressure (1~o2)  which remained constant but an increase in\\nblood lactate concentration was observed. Control exchange\\ntransfusion with fresh guinea pig blood had no effect on acid-base\\nstatus, on oxygen transport, or on  peripheral resistance. The sudden\\nreduction in haemoglobin oxygen affinity induced an increase in\\nperipheral resistance with a decrease in cardiac output, the arterial\\nsystemic pressure being maintained.  These results suggested that an\\nacute decrease in haemoglobin oxygen affinity was compensated for  by\\na simultaneous diminution of overall tissue blood flow and reduction\\nof capillary recruitment.

SOULARD et al.  fusion of blood with cyanate-enriched\\nhomologous blood (Woodson et al., 1973)  was demonstrated to induce a\\nreduction in physical performance of rat, interpreted  as a reduction\\nin oxygen delivery to tissues. On the other hand, few data from the\\nliterature are available concerning acute decrease in oxygen affinity\\ndue to the  unavailability of a substance diffusing through the red\\ncell membrane and increasing  Ps0 (Po2 at 50~o saturation) (Litwin et\\nal., 1977; Teisseire et al., 1979). By inducing  experimentally a\\nlarge increase in intra-erythrocytic 2,3-DPG, Valeri et al. (1974)\\nwere able to modify Ps0 only by a small amplitude. Affinity was\\nlowered in vivo  by the infusion of glycolytic intermediates (Krall et\\nal., 1978) in dogs but the change  in Ps0 was modest.  The purpose of\\nthis work was to obtain experimentally (in acute conditions) a\\nsubstantial ( > 10 mm Hg) increase in Ps0 without concomitant change\\nin acid-base  status. This goal could be achieved by exchange\\ntransfusion of guinea pigs using rat  erythrocytes. The effects on\\noxygen transport and delivery of a large rise in Ps0  from 25 to 37 mm\\nHg were investigated. A rightward shift of the ODC should produce\\neither an increase in oxygen consumption (Vo2) if oxygen arterio-\\nvenous difference  (AVDo) remains within normal limits, or a decrease\\nin cardiac output if ~\\'o2 is  maintained (Duvelleroy et al., 1973;\\nTurek et al., 1973).  Methods  Fifteen male guinea pigs (average\\nweight: 291 + 28 g, mean + SD) were anaesthetized  with\\nintraperitoneal pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) and ventilated via an\\nendotracheal  tube. The mechanical ventilation (Minerve, Paris)\\nallowed the adjustment  of respiratory frequency and tidal volume to\\nmaintain an arterial CO2 partial pressure  (Paco2) of 35 mm Hg.\\nExchange transfusion was performed by injection of  blood into an\\nexposed jugular vein and withdrawal from an exposed carotid artery,\\nat the rate of 1 ml/min. The blood volume simultaneously removed and\\nreplaced  amounted to 25 ml. In each experiment the haematocrit of the\\ntransfused blood was  adjusted to reproduce the value of the\\ntransfused guinea pig (39.4 + 1.5~o). The  donor animals were rats\\nweighing 400 + 52 g. Two rats were necessary for each  guinea pig\\ntransfusion. Cross-matching was carried out in each experiment, with\\nrat  red cells and guinea pig plasma.  The control group (group I)\\ncorresponded to 5 guinea pigs transfused with whole  blood collected\\none hour previously from 2 animals of the same species. In these\\nanimals homologous blood exchange transfusion did not induce any\\nsignificant  change in Ps0 (table 1). Group II included 10 guinea pigs\\nin which blood was  exchanged with a suspension in homologous plasma\\nof rat erythrocytes. The Ps0  of rat\\'s blood at time of collection was\\n37.5 + 1.5 mm Hg (n = 20) in standard  conditions (pH = 7.40, Pco2 =\\n40 mm Hg, temperature: 37 ). Before infusion rat  erythrocytes were\\nwashed three times in saline buffer solution and suspended in  guinea\\npig plasma in order to obtain a 40% haematocrit: 39.2 +_ 1.4~o for\\ngroup I  LOW 02 AFFINITY OF HAEMOGLOBIN 23  and 40.4 + 1.5~o for group\\nII. Group I and group II guinea pigs were ventilated  with ambient air\\nthroughout the transfusion period and subsequent measurements.  Rectal\\ntemperature recorded continuously during the experiment was kept at\\n37.5 -b 0.5 .  Arterial and venous blood samples were withdrawn from\\nthe canulated carotid  artery and from a catheter placed in the right\\nventricle via the internal jugular vein.  Samples were analyzed within\\n15 min after completion of the exchange transfusion.  Po,, Pco~ and pH\\nwere measured using a BMS3 apparatus (Radiometer) with standard\\nelectrodes at 37 . Haemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation\\n(Sat Hbo~)  were determined with an OSM.~ apparatus (Radiometer) and\\noxygen contents (Co.,)  with a Lex-O2-Con device (Lexington\\nInstruments). Plasma lactate and glucose  concentrations were\\ndetermined enzymatically (Bergmeyer, 1965). O2 and CO2  content of\\nexpired gas was analyzed in each exlaeriment by the Scholander\\ntechnique.  Taking into account the expired volume per minute (\\'~\\'E)\\nmeasured in ATPS conditions  and corrected in STPD conditions, 02\\nconsumption (Vo2) in STPD conditions  was obtained after determination\\nof Flo2 , FEo2, and FEco_,.

The ODCs were\\ndirectly obtained on whole blood samples with a Dissociation  Curve\\nAnalyser (DCA, Radiometer) according to Duvelleroy et al. (1970). The\\noriginal method was adapted (Teisseire et al., 1975) to allow a rapid\\n(5 min) ODC  recording from small samples of whole blood (300-500/zl),\\nthe pH and Pco2 values  being kept constant throughout the oxygenation\\nprocess. The pH of the blood  sample immediately before ODC recording\\nwas precisely adjusted in order to be  identical to the pH actually\\nmeasured on the corresponding sample. The Pco~, was  similarly\\nadjusted. Then for each blood sample, two Ps0 values were obtained\\nfrom  two dissociation curves drawn in standard conditions (pH = 7.40,\\nPco2 = 40 mm Hg,  temperature: 37) and in vivo conditions (animal pH,\\nPco2 and temperature).  Hill\\'s constant at 50~o Sat HbO2 (ns0) was\\ncomputed from the slope of the straight  line drawn between the 30~\\nand 70~ oxyhaemoglobin saturation values on a log-log  graph of Sat\\nHbO2/(100 - Sat HbO2) versus Po.,. At the end of the experimental\\nprocedure, each animal was sacrificed and a post-mortem examination\\nwas performed.

For\\neach guinea pig of the group II, the positions of the arterial and\\nmixed venous  points on the ODC, before and after exchange\\ntransfusion, are illustrated in fig. 2.  The trend of these variables\\nappeared to be identical in each individual experiment.  Discussion\\nOne possible explanation for the increase in peripheral vascular\\nresistance is a  difference in rheological properties of the rat\\nerythrocyte transfused into the guinea  pig. In fact, the dimensions\\nof guinea pig red blood cells (RBC) were very similar  to those of rat\\nRBC. The average diameter of guinea pig erythrocytes is 7.4 + 0.5/~m\\nand that of rats 7.5 _+ 0.7 #m according to Albritton (1952). For an\\nidentical  haematocrit ratio (40~), the absolute viscosity measured at\\n37  of whole guinea  pig blood and of composite blood made of rat\\nerythrocytes suspended in guinea pig  plasma was not significantly\\ndifferent at either low or high shear rates (table 3).  The optimal\\ncontrol group would have been guinea pigs transfused with rat RBC\\nhaving a decreased Ps0 down to 25 mm Hg as a result of 2,3-DPG\\ndepletion. This  procedure was excluded because such a decrease in\\n2,3-DPG concentration in rat  RBC requires 24 h storage of blood at\\nlaboratory temperature (or 4 h at 37 ).  In fact, such a depletion in\\nrat RBC 2,3-DPG led to a marked increase in the  absolute blood\\nviscosity (measured at 37 ) as illustrated in table 3.  As expected\\nthe exchange transfusion procedure on adult guinea pigs, with rat\\nerythrocytes produced a profound fall in the oxygen haemoglobin\\naffinity. There  was a large increase in Ps0 as shown by ODC\\nregistrations in standard conditions  TABLE 3  Measurements of\\nabsolute viscosity (cP), at the same haematocrit ratio (40~) of (l)\\nrat RBC suspended  in guinea pig plasma; (2) guinea pig whole blood;\\n(3) rat blood with low 2,3-DPG concentration  Shear rate Fresh guinea\\npig Fresh rat erythrocytes Low DPG concentration  (s I) whole blood\\nsuspended in guinea rat whole blood  (n = 5) plasma (n = 5) (24 h at\\n20 ) (n = 5)  0.01 112 + 25 109 9_ 21 NS 667 _+ 30 *  100 4.7 + 1.0\\n4.0 1.2 NS 8.4 + 1.4 *  * P < 0.001.  28 c.D. SOULARD et al.  (pH =\\n7.40, Pco., = 40 mm Hg). As the arterial acid-base state of guinea\\npigs was  found to be identical before and after exchange transfusion\\nwith rat RBC, the  measurement of the in vivo Ps0 indicated the same\\namplitude for the P50 increase.  Such an ODC shift may represent an\\nexample of a \\'pure\\' Ps0 effect. To reproduce a  similar rightward\\nshift to the ODC due to the fixed acid Bohr effect itself the  pH\\nvalue of the guinea pig blood should have been decreased to 7.03. It\\nwas shown  by Frans et al. (1979) that Ps0 increase in dogs where a\\nmarked acidosis was induced  by ammonium chloride was limited to 6 mm\\nHg. The amplitude of the ODC shift  induced in the present\\nexperiments, without concomitant change in blood acidity,  appeared to\\nbe very large when compared to the results of the literature. Bristow\\net al. (1977), Krall et al. (1978), observed a 2 4 mm Hg maximal\\nincrease of Ps0 by  intravenous infusions of glycolytic intermediates\\ninto Labrador dogs. A very modest  increase of Ps0 (3-4 mm Hg)\\nresulted from transfusion of previously 2,3-DPG  enriched red cells as\\nreported by Valeri et al. (1974) on baboons, and by Denis  et al.\\n(1975) on patients. A small though significant increase in Ps0 (6 and\\n8 mm Hg,  respectively) has been previously obtained by long-term\\nadministration of sodium  iodobenzoate either intravenously (Litwin et\\nal., 1977) or intraperitoneally (Teisseire  et al., 1979) in dogs and\\nrats.  In the present work the significant increase in Pao2, did not\\nappear to be dependent  on a change in ventilation, the Paco~\\nremaining within the physiological range. An  increase in Pao2 was\\nalso reported by Delivoria-Papadopoulos et al. (1976) after  exchange\\ntransfusion of low-birth-weight infants with adult blood, the\\nassociated  rise of Ps0 being from 19 to 25 mm Hg. The major\\nconsequences of the induced  acute increase in Ps0 appeared to be an\\nincrease in AVDo~ with a decrease in systemic  output but without\\nchange in Vo_~ and Pro:. The stability of both respiratory  quotient\\nand CO2 production before and after exchange transfusion suggested the\\nabsence of a metabolic disturbance resulting from the increase in Ps0.\\nThe venous  Pco2 and lactate concentration increases after exchange\\ntransfusion in group II were  interpreted as a consequence of the\\nalteration in systemic output. Two possible  adaptative mechanisms may\\nexplain the physiological sequelae of an acute increase  in Ps~J.\\nSince there is a constancy in \"~o: and Cao, the observed AVDo~\\nincrease had  to be compensated for by decrease in systemic output.\\nSuch a change would  correspond to a pure circulatory adaptation. As\\nsystemic arterial pressure remained  unchanged the end result was an\\nincrease in peripheral resistance. Martin et al.  (1979) suggested an\\nincrease in capillary recruitment as a consequence of a Ps0  decrease.\\nAn inverse phenomenon could be postulated when an increase in Ps~ is\\ninduced. The rightwardshift of the ODC might increase the oxygen\\ndiffusion from  the arteriolar lumen to the adjacent tissues. Another\\nresult may be the increased  oxygenation of the smooth muscles of the\\nprecapillary sphincters. It has been shown  that in moderate\\nhyperoxemia the precapillary sphincters sustain contraction for  a\\nlonger time than in normal conditions (Bourdeau-Martini et al., 1974).\\nThe  authors postulated a biochemical mechanism for this vasoactive\\neffect involving  the ATPase activity of smooth muscle actomyosin, the\\nutilisation and conservation  LOW 0 2 AFFINITY OF HAEMOGLOBIN 29  of\\nATP and the local 02 availability. They showed that the arterial\\noxygen tension  had a strong influence on the perfused capillaries of\\nthe epicardium. Lindbom  et al. (1980) established an inverse\\nrelationship between the arterial Po,, and the  number of Open\\ncapillaries of rabbit skeletal muscle.  An increase in Ps0 would be\\ncompensated for by decreasing both systemic output  and capillary\\nrecruitment. The nature of the control mechanism by which capillary\\ndensity decreases when Ps0 increases cannot be elucidated from these\\nexperiments.  However, it may be postulated that low affinity enhances\\n02 diffusion from the red  cells and by an unknown control feedback\\nmechanism some precapillary sphincters  may contract.

This condition does not involve  the central nervous\\nsystem (CNS) and is characterized by a state of hyperactive\\nimmunocompetent responsiveness. It develops as the result  of an\\nantigenic challenge by a viral protein, either from a viral infection\\nor a vaccination. In order for MS to become a disease affecting  the\\nCNS, it is necessary for the blood-brain barrier\\'s (BBB)\\nimpermeability to be altered. This is now a fully recognized fact. As\\na result  of this change, the MS lesion, which consists of edema and\\ninflammation occurs. It may but need not lead to demyelination.\\nSeveral  mechanisms can cause this increased permeability of the BBB.\\nThe role of the immune system, and in particular of T lymphocytes in\\ninitiating and continuing the process of lesion formation remains\\nextremely controversial. In fact, there are unanswered questions\\nregarding  the actual target of MS: is it the myelin sheath itself or\\nits forming cell, the oligodendrocyte, or is it the BBB itself leading\\nto bystander  demyelination? The role of mild, concussional trauma to\\nthe CNS in producing the alteration of the BBB and therefore acting as\\na trigger  or facilitator in the development or enlargement of MS\\nlesions in the CNS, is based on considerable clinical,\\nneuropathological and  experimental evidence. Along with another viral\\ninfection, it must be one of the commonest causes of progression of\\nMS, and quite often  leads to the onset of the clinical manifestations\\nof an hitherto asymptomatic condition.    Introduction    A number of\\nsteps in the pathogenetic development of  multiple sclerosis are still\\nunknown.  In two previous publications (Poser 1986, 1992a) regard-\\ning the pathogenesis of MS, I proposed two new concepts:  first, that\\na multiple sclerosis \"trait\" existed as a systemic  condition,\\ncharacterized by a state of hyperactive immuno-  competent\\nresponsiveness, and second, that an alteration of  the blood-brain\\nbarrier (BBB) was an obligatory step in the  formation of the MS\\nlesion, which consisted of edema and  inflammation that can but does\\nnot always lead to demyeli-  nation. I emphasized that this change in\\nBBB permeability  is nonspecific, results in a greater vulnerability,\\nwhich is  inherent in the MS trait, and could be increased by a number\\nof factors including immune responses, trauma, electrical  injury, and\\nothers. Several publications have since provided  further support for\\nthe view that the BBB plays a crucial  role in the pathogenesis of MS.\\nCorrespondence to: Charles M.

It is the purpose of this paper to\\nreview this new material  and to examine the process which results in\\nthe disease  becoming progressive in some patients even following a\\nsingle event which has changed the protection afforded by  the BBB.\\nTherefore, I further propose that in some in-  stances, a major\\ndisturbance of BBB impermeability may  affect the further course of\\nthe illness. In so doing, I no  longer support some opinions which I\\nhad expressed some  years ago (Poser 1979) but which do not seem valid\\nin view  of the publication since then of an enormous amount of\\nimportant new information.  Because much of this material has already\\nappeared in  print, it will not be repeated here; rather the reader is\\nre-  ferred to the 1986 and 1992a articles.    The multiple sclerosis\\ntrait    The fact that a genetically determined factor plays an\\nimportant role in the acquisition of MS has now been estab-  lished on\\nthe basis 0f twin studies, epidemiological surveys,  and studies of\\nthe histocompatibility system. These studies  have been discussed in\\ndetail by Compston (1991a). The    $4    nature and mode of\\ntransmission of this genetic susceptibil-  ity remain unknown,\\nalthough the latter appears to be par-  ticularly strong among the\\ndescendants of populations that  originated in Scandinavia and\\nNortheastern Europe (Poser  1992a). The presence of the genetic\\nsusceptibility in a per-  son will determine if she or he will develop\\nthe MS \"trait\",  although not necessarily exhibit the clinical\\nmanifestations  of MS. The problem is complicated by the fact that a\\nsig-  nificant number of persons who have MS lesions go through  life\\nwithout exhibiting any symptoms of the disease (Poser  et al. 1992).\\nIt is more than likely that the MS trait does not  affect all members\\nof a family.  It is most important to realize that the factors that\\ncause  an individual to develop the MS \"trait\" are quite different\\nfrom those that cause the person to have MS lesions in the  central\\nnervous system, symptomatic or not.    The nature of the MS \"trait\"\\nThe MS \"trait\" is defined as a permanent state of hyper-  active or\\nintensified immunoeompetent responsiveness or  capability, which is\\ntriggered in the genetically susceptible  individual by exposure to a\\nnon-specific antigen that is  almost certainly of viral origin, either\\nan acute viral infec-  tion or a vaccination. The possible importance\\nof the latter  seems to have been generally overlooked. Despite the\\nfact  that there are still some adherents to the theory of a persist-\\nent specific viral agent, the most recent ones being the  corona virus\\n(Murray et al. 1992) and a still unidentified  retrovirus (Rudge\\n1991), the consistent failure to confirm  the role of such a specific\\norganism in the pathogenesis of  MS had raised grave doubts about its\\nexistence.  The presence of the MS \"trait\" simply means that a\\nsystemic condition, which does not itself involve the nerv-  ous\\nsystem, is created that makes the person a potential  victim of MS, a\\ndisease of the central nervous system  (CNS), provided a further event\\ntakes place. The classic  examples of a trait are acute intermittent\\nporphyria and  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Not all\\nthe  components of this MS trait have been defined. One of them\\nappears to be a very vigorous antibody response to a great  variety of\\nviral, and possibly other, antigens. This was origi-  nally\\ndemonstrated by Brody et al. (1971) and confirmed by  several other\\nauthors (Panelius et al. 1973, Woyciechowska  et al. 1985, Kinnunen et\\nal. 1990). Haile et al. (1981) were  able to demonstrate the presence\\nof circulating immune  complexes in the blood of unaffected siblings\\nof MS pa-  tients. This would be another expression of the MS \"trait\".\\nThe lack of specificity noted in the elevated titers of antivi-  ral\\nantibodies in these studies may be a reflection of the  person\\'s\\nprevious immunological experience. For example,  vaccination against\\nmany diseases is widespread in devel-  oped countries where, perhaps\\ncoincidentally or beeause of  ethnic factors, the prevalence of MS is\\nhighest. The phe-    nomenon of molecular mimicry (Fujinami et al.\\n1983) may  play a role in the acquisition of the MS \"trait\", as it may\\ndo  also at a later stage of the development of the disease (see\\nbelow). Noble et al. (1977) showed that the administration  of swine\\ninfluenza vaccine to normal volunteers in New  Jersey in 1976 caused a\\nrise in titers of other influenza  vaccines. It is germane to point\\nout as did Isacson and Stone  (1971) that all vaccines contain a very\\nlarge number of  antigens in addition to the specific killed or\\nattenuated virus  that is the presumably \"active\" ingredient.  Another\\nprobable component of the MS trait consists of  the presence in the\\nCSF of unaffected siblings, including  non-concordant twins, of MS\\npatients, of immunoglobulin  G oligoclonal bands (OB) (Xu and McFarlin\\n1984;  Duquette 1991). It is true that some, but as far as is known,\\nnot all of these persons had abnormalities on magnetic reso-  nance\\nimaging (MR/) interpreted as being MS lesions and  that they also\\ndeveloped clinical signs and symptoms of the  disease. Nevertheless,\\nLynch and Rose\\'s (1991) reply to  Duquette\\'s letter is most\\ninteresting in that it actually hints  at the existence of the MS\\ntrait: \"Previous studies have  indicated that many otherwise healthy\\nsiblings with family  members affected with MS have abnormal studies\\nassoci-  ated with MS such as MR/abnormalities and CSF oligo-  clonal\\nbands. These individuals may represent a population  who carry an MS\\nsusceptibility factor but did not encounter  sufficient environmental\\nstimulus to precipitate MS, or per-  haps they carry one or two or\\nthree genetic susceptibility  factors present in these families as\\nsuggested by Duquette\".  It is beyond the scope of this paper to\\ndiscuss the possible  significance of CSF OB in MS, since the topic\\nhas been  explored by many authors, who have all come to the con-\\nclusion that it remains completely mysterious and may play  no role\\nwhatsoever in the pathogenesis of the disease. How-  ever, CSF OB\\nremain present for the entire life of the  patient, regardless of the\\nclinical state of the disease; the  nature of the antibodies contained\\nin them remains un-  known, and, most intriguing, no one, including\\nexperts such  as Link, Lowenthal, and Traugott (personal communica-\\ntions) seems to know if the cells that produce the IgG  (presumably\\nB-lymphocytes and plasma cells) are continu-  ously introduced from\\nperipheral blood or if they proliferate  in situ within the CNS.\\nLymphocyte secretion of IgG may  be an expression of the increased but\\nnon-specific immune-  competent responsiveness in the MS \"trait\".\\nAnother aspect of this exaggerated immune response is  an\\ninflammatory, primarily lymphocytic, infiltration of  small blood\\nvessels, primarily venules and capillaries, that  do not lead to the\\ndevelopment of white matter alterations.  This was clearly\\ndemonstrated by Adams et al. (1985) and  further illustrated by Gay\\nand Esiri ( 1991) who showed that  these infiltrates found in normal\\nwhite matter of MS patients  which are both perivascular in nature and\\ninvolve the blood  vessel wall itself, produce a very minor alteration\\nof the    BBB which cannot be demonstrated by gadolinium en-\\nhancement of magnetic resonance imaging (MR/). These  vascular changes\\nmay be the pathway for B-lymphocytes to  penetrate into the CNS where\\nthey produce OB.    Genetic susceptibility and host specificity\\nMany investigators have used experimental allergic en-\\ncephalomyelitis (EAE) as the animal model for MS. There  are\\nsimilarities between the two conditions that have been  well\\nsummarized by Allen (1991): \"although there is evi-  dence of the\\npossible importance of immune-competent and  antigen-presenting cells\\nin demyelination in MS, there can  be no firm conclusion that the\\ndisease is autoimmune. It is  premature to deduce from the\\nexperimental evidence avail-  able that we have an exact or even a\\ngood model of MS\".  On the other hand, there is little question, as\\nwas pointed  out by Lumsden (1972) that, up to a point, EAE (as well\\nas  its natural equivalents, post-infectious and post-vaccinal en-\\ncephalomyelitis) have a similar pathogenetic sequence. It is  quite\\nclear that the speculations and conclusions found in  many\\npublications are extrapolations of EAE results to MS.  Thus in their\\nextensive review of the putative immunologi-  cal basis of MS,\\nLassmann et al. (1991) suggest that \"the  minimal requirement to start\\nbrain inflammation is the pres-  ence of activated circulating T cells\\ndirected against a brain  antigen and of antigen presenting cells in\\nmeninges and  perivascular spaces. Other local and systemic\\nimmunologi-  cal factors may profoundly lower the threshold for the\\nin-  duction of brain inflammation. They include antigen recog-\\nnition on cells in brain parenchyma (microglia, astrocytes),  local\\nupregulation of MHC antigens and possibly adhesion  molecules (by\\ncytokines or as a consequence of brain in-  jury) and the presence of\\nadditional humoral immune re-  sponses against brain antigens\\n(autoantibodies). Focal pro-  duction of cytokines by inflammatory\\ncells as well as by  resident cells of the brain plays an important\\nrole in deter-  mining the activity of the inflammatory process and in\\nin-  ducing effector cells and inflammatory mediators responsi-  ble\\nfor tissue destruction. Whereas in pure T-cell mediated  EAE these\\nactivated effector mechanisms have low selec-  tivity and mainly\\ninduce a \\'bystander\\' damage of CNS  tissue, additional presence of\\nautoantibodies may focus the  immune reaction to specific targets,\\nthus inducing very se-  lective tissue destruction\". There is no\\nconvincing evidence  at this time that this proposed mechanism is\\noperative in  MS.  It is important to recognize in both diseases that\\nthe  response of the individual to the antigenic stimulus is host-\\ndependent and not antigen-dependent. In other words, given  the same\\ninfection or vaccine, the vast majority of persons  will have no\\nneurological response at all, some will develop  typical\\nencephalomyelitis, but others will develop MS.  Two dramatic reports\\nillustrate the specificity of the host    $5    response: of the 45\\npersons who died as a result of compli-  cations of anti-rabies\\nvaccination in Japan in the 1950s, 36  had the neuropathological\\ncharacteristic changes of post-  vaccinal disseminated\\nencephalomyelitis but 9 had lesions  indistinguishable from those of\\nMS (Uchimura and Shiraki  1957). Perhaps even more striking is the\\nreport that out of  11 persons given anti-rabies vaccine who were\\nexamined at  autopsy in Colombia by Toro et al. (1977), 10 developed\\nacute post-vaccinal disseminated encephalomyelitis, but  one had\\nlesions characteristic of MS.    The role of the immune system in the\\npathogenesis of MS    With the exception of the clearly demonstrable\\nchanges  which are manifestations of the MS trait, the changes found\\nin the immune system of MS patients are complex and  numerous but most\\nimportantly, non-specific (Lisak 1986).  It is unfortunate that many\\nstudies of immune changes are  based upon extrapolations from EAE to\\nMS, and often it is  difficult if not impossible to tell which\\ncondition they refer  to. For many years, researchers have made\\nthousands of  studies of the role of T-lymphocytes in the disease.\\nThese  can be summarized as follows: they are found in and near  the\\nMS lesion; activated T-cells are able to penetrate  through the\\npresumably intact BBB; they do not play a  direct role in the\\ndestruction of myelin (Compston 1991b),  but there has been much\\nspeculation that they might secrete  cytokines, which play such a\\nrole, but this has not yet been  demonstrated. They do not attack\\noligodendrocytes. Raine  (1991) states his strong belief in the\\nimportance of the T cell  in MS pathogenesis in the title of his\\narticle: \"MS: a pivotal  role for the T cell in lesion development\".\\nThere has also  been general agreement that while myelin basic protein\\n(MBP) or one of its component fragments is the antigen  responsible\\nfor myelinoclasia in EAE, it does not play the  same role in MS; what\\nis most puzzling, however, is the  fact, reported by several\\ninvestigators, that peripheral blood  T-cells in MS patients (but also\\nin some healthy controls)  are responsive to a host of myelin\\ncomponents such as  myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin-oligodendrocyte\\ngly-  coprotein (MOG), myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) and  GM-1\\nganglioside (Amon et al. 1980; Johnson et al. 1986;  Olsson et al.\\n1990; Zamvil and Steinman 1990; Martino et  al. 1991; Sun et al. 1991;\\nChou et al. 1992).  Zamvil and Steinman (1990) stated in summary, \"in\\nMS  we do not know if these myelin reactive T-cells are causa-  tive\\nor if they occur secondarily\". While one cannot be  certain about the\\nsignificance of T cell activation by all the  components of myelin\\nmentioned above, the role of MBP is  certainly in doubt: Wekerle et\\nal. (1986) injected very high  numbers of activated MBP reactive\\nT-lymphocytes into the  CSF without inducing any tissue damage in the\\nCNS paren-  chyma.  Jingzu et al. (1992) recently reported that the\\nfrequency    $6    of MPB-reactive T-cells in the peripheral blood of\\nnormal  subjects was essentially the same as that in MS patients and\\nconcluded that the relevance of T-cell responses to MBP to  the\\npathogenesis of MS remains controversial. It is not yet  known if the\\nsame statement applies to PLP, MOG or GM-1  ganglioside. Two possible\\nexplanations may be offered for  the existence of the activation of\\nT-lymphocytes by myelin  components. The first one is that it is a\\nmanifestation of the  phenomenon of molecular mimicry. Alvord (1985)\\nand  Jahnke et al. (1985) have demonstrated that several viruses\\nshare protein amino acid sequences with MBP (Table 1) and  therefore a\\nperson who has the MS \"trait\" (but also normals)  may respond to those\\nantigens. This suggestion was sup-  ported by Chou et al. (1992).\\nAnother example of possibly  relevant molecular mimicry is the report\\nof protein se-  quence similarity between decapeptides from rubella\\nand  measles virus and human proteolipid protein (Atkins et al.\\n1990). Note that the same proteins are also contained in  rubella and\\nmeasles vaccines administered routinely to chil-  dren in practically\\nall the developed countries. It is probable  although not yet shown\\nthat antigenic similarities may also  exist between viral proteins and\\nother myelin components.  A second possibility, is that the obligatory\\nopening of the  BBB and the destruction of myelin, releases into the\\nperiph-  eral circulation breakdown products of myelin which then\\nstart T-cell activation. The origin of the substances from  destroyed\\nmyelin was first mentioned by Oger et al. (1988)  and also by Zamvil\\nand Steinman (1990). Olsson (1990)  pointed out that they had observed\\nautoreactive T-cells as a  result of BBB breakdown in acute\\ncerebrovascular disease.  However, in regard to MBP, the report by\\nJingzu et al.  (1992) would contradict this. If indeed the T-cell\\nplays a  role in MS pathogenesis, as is firmly believed by many\\ninvestigators, then the CNS-to-blood traffic through the  opened BBB\\nwould provide a constant source of antigeni-  cally activating\\nsubstances for T-cells.  A number of investigators have expressed\\ndoubt about  the role played by immunological reactions in the patho-\\ngenesis of demyelination including Behan (personal com-  munication),\\nWisniewski and Bloom (1985), Oger et al.  (1988), Gay and Esiri\\n(1991), but it was expressed most  forcefully by Wolfgram (1979) who\\nstated \"Three decades  of myopic preoccupation with EAE have resulted\\nin limit-  ing our investigation almost exclusively to immunology and\\nvirology although either discipline has yet to offer a credible\\nexplanation of the etiology of MS  ....  The demyelination and  the\\ndeath of oligodendrocytes proceed; macrophages and  lymphocytes invade\\nthe demyelinating areas and an immu-  nologic reaction is generated.\\nThis immunological reaction  has nothing to do with the demyelination\\nexcept to clean up  the debris. In short, we have mistaken the smoke\\nfor the  fire\".    What is the target organ in the pathogenesis of MS?\\nThere is a consensus that MS is an inflammatory disease  and that the\\nprimary change in the blood vessel wall that  leads to a possible or\\neventual alteration of the BBB is an  inflammatory one. The exact\\nmechanism by which this oc-  curs remains unknown, although a number\\nof suggestions  have been made.  It is likely that the most common\\ncause of an inflamma-  tory reaction involving the blood vessel is a\\nviral infection.  This has been demonstrated in canine distemper virus\\ninfec-  tion of the brain in which a perivascular reaction and in-\\nflammatory changes in the vessel wall were shown to be  identical to\\nthose seen in MS (Summers et al. 1979; Ax-  thelm and Krakowka 1987).\\nThe same can be observed as  the result of a vaccination, a mechanism\\nwhich is identical  with what is seen in EAE (Poser 1969). Reik\\n(19980) pro-  posed that the inflammatory reaction was due to the\\ndepo-  sition of immune complexes, and Coyle et al. (1980) and  others\\nfelt that this was also the causative mechanism in  MS. Gay and Esiri\\n(1991) demonstrated the presence of  immune complexes in the\\nperivascular spaces of acute MS  lesions, and commented that it may\\nnot be assumed that the  f\\'mding of complexed material in lesions is\\ncertain evidence  that the complexes are the cause of the damage, but\\na  primary pathological role for the complexes is suggested by  their\\nexclusive association with acute plaques and their dis-  position\\nwithin HLA-DR+ve macrophages in the advancing  borders of small\\nhyperactive lesions.  The phenomenon of molecular mimicry (Alvord\\n1985,  Jahnke et al. 1985) may also play an extremely important  role\\nin causing the MS \"trait\" to become the actual CNS  disease: because\\nof the fact that excess antibodies against  certain viral proteins are\\npresent in the blood of the MS  \"trait\" carrier, an infection by a\\nsecond virus, or vaccination  containing viral proteins which share\\nepitopes with the an-  tigen(s) which originally produced the \"trait\"\\nmay result in  a further increase in either or both humoral or\\ncellular im-  munoresponsiveness, and the formation of immune com-\\nplexes. It can be seen in Table 1 that, for example, assuming  that\\nmeasles caused the development of the trait, a sub-  sequent infection\\nby influenza or a vaccination against it,  might produce such a\\nscenario.  Hickey (1991) and others have proposed that the inflam-\\nmatory reaction results from the action of activated lympho-  cytes\\nand macrophages but without stipulating an exact  mechanism. It has\\nalready been pointed out earlier that an  inflammatory reaction of\\nblood vessels resulting from an  initial viral infection or\\nvaccination may be considered to  be part of the MS \"trait\" and not\\nnecessarily lead to an  alteration of the BBB, at least one that is\\nsufficient to affect  myelin (Gay and Esiri 1991) or to cause MRI\\nchanges  (Estes et al. 1990).

Adapted from Alvord (1985) and Jahnke et al.  (1985).\\nReprinted with permission from the Saudi Medical Journal (Poser\\n1992b).    impermeability in the formation of the MS lesion, some\\nconsideration nmst be given to examining what is the target  organ in\\nMS. There are several possibilities that are not  necessarily mutually\\nexclusive. They include the oligoden-  droglial cell (ODC), the myelin\\nsheath itself, and the BBB.  A number of experienced investigators\\nhave focused on the  ODC as the primary target for the understandable\\nreason  that its cell membrane is the myelin sheath. Compston  (1991b)\\nspeaks of acute changes in the ODC and Hughes  (1992) wonders about\\ndamage to both the ODC and the  myelin sheath. The question of early\\ninvolvement of the  ODC in MS remains tmsolved: while\\nneuropathologists all  agree that these cells have disappeared from\\nthe older parts  of the MS plaques, others have noted an actual\\nincrease in  their number in the early lesions. In fact, a number of\\nprominent neuropathologists (Allen, Esiri, Richardson,  Schneck,\\npersonal communications) believe that the in-  volvement may be\\nsecondary to the destruction of myelin.  In my opinion, it is unlikely\\nthat ODC is the primary target  in MS for a number of reasons: the\\nareas of demyelination  in MS characteristically have a very sharp\\nedge which van  Bogaert described as being made by a cookie-cutter and\\nthus would not be restricted to the \"territory\" served by one  or more\\nODCs; the MS lesions are scattered, suggesting that  only some ODCs\\nare affected. This is in contrast with the  lesions seen in diseases\\nin which it is known that the ODCs  are the primary targets: the large\\nconfluent areas ofdemyeli-  nation of progressive multifocal\\nleukoencephalopathy, and  the almost total loss of myelin in the\\nentire brain seen in  some cases ofsubacute AIDS encephalitis in which\\nthe HIV  can be found in the ODCs (Gyorkey et al. 1987). Gay\\n(personal communication) noted that in the acute MS lesion  even when\\nactivated cells have moved into the parenchyma  and macrophages are\\nattached to the myelin sheaths, ODCs  are intact. The most powerful\\nargument against the primary  involvement of the ODC is that the\\ninitial, primary lesion  of the brain in MS is edema and inflammation\\nof the myelin  sheath and not its destruction. This will be discussed\\nin  more detail below.    The myelin sheath as the target organ\\nDespite the fact that MS has classically been called a  demyelinating\\ndisease, the destruction of the sheath is not  the primary event in\\nthe disease. Even in EAE, which is  considered by so many\\ninvestigators as the model for MS,  the initial lesion, as in MS,\\nconsists of inflammation and  edema. Rosen et al. (1990) reported in\\nexperimental allergic  neuritis (EAN) that endoneurial edema and\\nmyelin vesicu-  lation appeared several days before macrophage-\\nassociated  myelin stripping occurred. Dousset et al. (1992) using\\nmag-  netization transfer imaging proved that lesions of EAE were\\nedematous rather than demyelinating; they also demon-  strated the\\nsame phenomena in several MS patients. The  latter findings are\\nparticularly important in illustrating that  the standard MRI may not\\nreveal all MS lesions, in particu-  lar those in which myelinoclasia\\nhad not occurred. Poser et  al. (1987) had already concluded that the\\nareas of enhance-  ment obtained with double dose delayed contract\\nenhance-  ment in CT scanning in an MS patient during an acute\\nrelapse were the result of edema since they no longer ap-  peared in\\nan MRI obtained in the same patient shortly there-  after. Further\\nconfirmation of this idea came from the report  by Newcombe et al.\\n(1991) who were able to examine the  brains of MS patients they had\\nstudied by means of serial  MRIs: \"These postmortem observations\\nprovide support for  the view that the quickly resolving diffuse areas\\nof high  signal seen in vivo around lesions known from serial scan-\\nning and from gadolinium enhancement to be new, are due  to edema\".\\nOne of the major reasons for suspecting that  demyelination is not the\\nprimary event in MS, is the remark-  ably rapid recovery in a matter\\nof a few days, or even a few  hours in so many MS patients, of major\\nclinical signs and  symptoms, which occurs much faster than could be\\nex-  pected from remyelination. Furthermore, there is the rapid  and\\noften dramatic response of MS patients to the admini-  stration of\\ncorticosteroids, which are primarily anti-inflam-  matory and anti-\\nedema agents and have no known effect  upon demyelination.    $8\\nThe blood-brain barrier as the target organ    In a recent review, Gay\\nand Esiri (1991) have offered  convincing evidence to the effect that\\nthe BBB, and in  particular the blood vessel\\'s endothelial lining, may\\nin fact  be the target organ for MS. Tsukada et al. (1987) were able\\nto produce perivascular inflammatory, edematous and de-  myelinating\\nlesions very similar to those seen in EAE and  MS by injecting\\nantibodies against the animal\\'s endothelial  cells. Hughes (1992)\\nmakes the following statement in his  excellent essay on the\\npathogenesis of MS: \"evidence for a  primary or a very early\\nabnormality of leukocyte endothe-  lial interaction in MS comes from\\nthree sources. Firstly, the  inflammatory cell infiltrates commonly\\nsurround blood ves-  sels in the white matter of patients with MS even\\nin the  absence of demyelination. Secondly, retinal vasculitis has\\nbeen discovered in 18% of 50 consecutive cases of MS and  inflammation\\nin the retina cannot be explained by a neigh-  boring immune response\\nagainst myelin since the retinal  axons are not myelinated. Finally,\\nthe earliest radiologically  detectable event in MR/studies is a\\nlesion which enhances  following the intravenous injection of\\ngadolinium, indicat-  ing local breakdown of the BBB\". The evidence\\nthat both  B and T lymphocytes can penetrate through the intact BBB\\n(Hickey 1991) and that inflammatory cells collect in the  perivascular\\nspaces of normal white matter in MS patients  (Adams 1985; Gay and\\nEsiri 1991) suggests that the in-  volvement of the BBB in MS may be\\nof two types: minor  and major. The former would not lead to the\\nformation of  MS lesions but would be a component of the MS trait.\\nThis  means that as part of the MS trait, the BBB is more vulner-\\nable. The formation of MS lesions in the CNS in MS would  require a\\nmajor alteration of the impermeability of the BBB.  Compston (1991b)\\nhas stated that \"the available evidence  suggests that cell surface\\nadhesion molecule expression al-  ters when circulating T lymphocytes\\nand macrophages are  activated, increasing their endothelial cell\\nattachment; the  secretion of cytokines and locally active enzymes\\nleads to  transendothelial passage, opening the barrier and bringing\\nan army of potentially pathogenic inflammatory cells and  mediators to\\nthe abluminal surface of blood vessels\". This  hypothesis remains to\\nbe proved.  The key word in Compston\\'s statement is mediators, i.e.\\nsubstances rather than cells. Hickey (1991) made essentially  the same\\ncomment and even Lassmann et al. (1991) referred  to a number of\\nhumoral agents such as complement, tumor  necrosis factor and gamma-\\ninterferon which might conceiv-  ably play a role in a direct attack\\non myelin, or as effectors  of bystander demyelination in MS. Gay and\\nEsiri (1991)  comment that \"the appearance of considerable protein\\nleak-  age in normally myelinated areas around plaques suggests  that\\nleakage per se is not necessarily demyelinating. Our  results argue\\nagainst specific humoral immune-mediated  damage to myelin in MS and\\nsupport the idea that myelin    may be damaged as an innocent\\nbystander rather than as a  specific target in the inflammatory\\nreactions which develop  around and within the walls of cerebral\\nvessels\". The con-  cept of bystander demyelination deserves serious\\nconsidera-  tion because it is mentioned by a number of experienced\\nand  knowledgeable students of the problem of what happens  after the\\nBBB loses its impermeability.    The BBB in the pathogenesis of MS\\nIt has been known since 1949 (Broman) that an alteration  of the BBB\\nexisted in MS plaques, but the concept that such  a breakdown was a\\ncrucial and obligatory step in the patho7  genesis of the CNS MS\\nlesions was not proposed until 1986  (Poser). The background for this\\nhypothesis has been re-  viewed in detail elsewhere (Poser 1986,\\n1992a), The si~fi:  cance of this step in the pathogenetic sequence\\nlies in that  it activates the MS \"trait\" into producing the disease,\\nlead-  ing to the development of CNS lesions, some of which may\\nbecome permanent plaques, which may ormay not become  symptomatic\\neither shortly thereafter or at a later date. The  introduction of\\ncontrast-enhanced CT scanning, and more  particularly the many studies\\nusing gadolinium-enhanced  MRI, quickly transformed what had been an\\nhypothesis into  an accepted observation. The evidence produced in\\nthese  studies has also been reviewed previously (Poser 1992ai.  Since\\nthe publication of that article, confirmation of the  importance of\\nthis step has been made by a number of  prominent investigators.\\nCompston (1991b) stated that  \"BBB penetration can be regarded as the\\nprimary disease  process without which none of the events directly\\nresponsi-  ble for myelin injury would occur\". Rudge (1991) com-\\nments that \"that the disease [MS] is focal, characterized by\\ndemyelinating plaques, rather than diffuse in nature could  be\\nexplained in terms of local breakdown of the BBB. It is  clear that\\nsuch a breakdown is an early, if not the first, step  in plaque\\ngeneration\".  Hughes (1992) succinctly pointed out that \"an early\\nevent in the pathogenesis of MS must be an alteration of the  blood-\\nCNS barrier which does not normally permit passage  of immunoglobulin\\nor lymphocytes into the parenchyma of  the brain and spinal cord\".\\nHickey (1991) makes the state-  ment that \"it is obvious that any\\nmechanism which physi-  cally destroys the components of the BBB will\\nrender the  CNS open to the cellular and molecular constituents of the\\nblood. This occurs in traumatic or surgical injury, infarction  and\\nhemorrhage. In such circumstances the required partici-  pants for\\ninflammation are rapidly delivered to the site of  injury in a gross,\\nnon-specific fashion\", it is clear from all  these statements that the\\nbreakdown of the BBB is obliga-  tory, regardless of what mechanism\\nthen becomes activated;  be it by immunocompetent cells, humoral\\nfactors or as a  non-specific bystander phenomenon. This event is\\nimpor.  tant for two reasons: first is that a major alteration ofBBB\\npermeability has taken place, initiating the CNS phase of  MS.\\nSecondly, the nature of the event becomes important in  that the\\ngreater the damage to the BBB the more massive  the penetration into\\nthe CNS of potentially myelinoclastic  elements can be. This would be\\nthe case in events such as  those noted by Hickey (1991) above. In the\\nMS age group,  of all the events he mentions, trauma rather than\\ninfarction  and hemorrhage would seem to be by far the most common\\nand for this reason will be examined in greater detail.    The role of\\ntrauma in MS    Much of the relevant material has already been\\nreviewed  (Poser 1986, 1987, 1992a) and will not be repeated. It is\\nworth reiterating that trauma never actually causes MS and  that in\\norder for trauma to be considered significant in  aggravating or\\naccelerating the course of the disease, there  must be evidence of\\ninjury to the head, the neck, or the back  above the lumbo-sacral\\nregion, i.e. above the conus.  The importance of trauma in some MS\\npatients, at some  times, is that it greatly facilitates the entry\\ninto the brain  and/or spinal cord of whatever cellular or humoral\\nsub-  stances will result in the formation of new lesions or the\\nenlargement of already existing MS lesions. I am not sug-  gesting\\nthat trauma is the most common facilitator or trigger  for the\\nformation or enlargement of MS lesions in the CNS.  In addition to the\\nmuch more common infections, and the  underestimated role of vaccines,\\nother, rarer events and  factors may have similar consequences (Poser\\n1992a). I  have recently observed the triggering effect of toxins in\\ntwo  unique cases, able to penetrate the BBB in MS patients,  causing\\nfurther injury to an already damaged myelin sys-  tem: an\\norganophosphate insecticide (Wadia et al. 1974;  Abou-Donia 1981;\\nNaqvi et al. 1988) and toluene (Escobar  and Aruffo 1980; Rosenberg et\\nal. 1988; Filley et al. 1990).    The effect of concussion on the\\nbrain    There has been a great deal of misunderstanding regard-    $9\\ning the degree of trauma that must be sustained in order to  cause\\norganic changes in the nervous system including al-  terations of the\\nBBB. A number of excellent publications,  reviewed by Rimel et al.\\n(198 I), Binder (1986), and Jenkins  et al. (1986) have stressed the\\nseverity of mild trauma. Kelly  et al. (1991) reported a\\nclassification devised by the Colo-  rado Medical Society which helped\\nclarify the definition of  concussion. They recognized three stages of\\nconcussion:  grade 1: confusion without amnesia or loss of conscious-\\nness; grade 2: confusion with amnesia but without loss of\\nconsciousness, and grade 3: loss of consciousness. The fact  that\\nconcussion could cause anatomic alterations of the  brain, i.e.\\nrecognizable lesions, had been pointed out as long  ago as 1964 by\\nOmmaya et al., by Nevin (1967), and again  by Oppenheimer in 1968. The\\nclassic review of the effect  of trauma on the nervous system by\\nHardman (1979) rein-  forces these views.    The effect of concussion\\non the BBB    The fact that trauma could result in alterations of the\\nBBB in man, which was already recognized by Bakay et al.  in 1977, was\\nreinforced by a number of studies using the  MRI: Jenkins et al.\\n(1986) and Levin et al. (1987, 1988,  1992). In a number of these\\npapers, MRI abnormalities were  found in both gray and white matter.\\nLevin et al. (1988)  indicated that out of 50 of their patients who\\nhad suffered  mild head injuries, lesions restricted to the\\nsubcortical white  matter were present in nine.  The fact that trauma\\ncan produce white matter lesions  visible by MRI is illustrated: a\\nhealthy 32-year-old man hit  his head on the windshield of his car\\nwhen it was hit from  behind. He suffered from a grade 1 concussion.\\nBecause of  persistent headaches, he was seen about 2 weeks later. His\\nneurological examination was entirely normal except for  some mild\\nspasm of the cervical musculature. An MRI (Fig.  1) showed bilateral\\nfrontal white matter lesions on the T2-  weighted image. The patient\\nmade a complete recovery  about a month later. The MRI was not\\nrepeated.    Fig. 1.

Much of the animal experimental\\ndata showing that al-  terations of the BBB can be produced by mild\\nconcussional  trauma has been reviewed (Poser 1986, 1992a). Some addi-\\ntional material is worth mentioning. What was undoubtedly  the first\\nobservation that an alteration of the BBB could  occur in the brain in\\nan area removed from the site of injury  was made by Gudmundsson in\\n1959 (Fig. 2; unpublished  observation). Maxwell et al. (1988)\\nproduced petedaial  hemorrhages, including areas of disruption of\\nendothelial  cells, in the central white matter of baboons subjected\\nto  lateral head acceleration. Ultrastructural changes resulting  from\\nconcussional trauma to the spinal cord ofanimals were  also\\ndemonstrated by Hsu et al. (1985), Kapadia (1984) and  by Goodman et\\nal. (1976). A particularly interesting publi-  cation is the one by\\nDomer et al. (1979), who used intrave-  nously administered\\nradioactive pertectmetate to show a  significant increase in BBB\\npermeability in animals sub-  jected to a whiplash injury who\\nsustained no trauma to the  head. There is, therefore, ample evidence\\nto support the idea  that mild concnssional trauma may cause an\\nalteration of  BBB.    The effect of trauma on the BBB in MS\\nGonsette et al. (1966) were the first to recognize that  opening the\\nBBB by using a brain needle to perform a  thalamotomy on several MS\\npatients, resulted in the forma-  tion of new plaques near the needle\\ntract. Riechert et al.  (1975) also noted this but commented that it\\ndid not always  occur. Brain and Wilkinson (1957) noted the eff~t of\\ncer-  vical spondylosis on the presence of MS plaques in the  cervical\\ncord, an observation that Oppe~imer (! 978) con-  firmed by pmt-mortem\\nexamination. Indeed Rudge (1991)  agreed when he stated that \"although\\nthere are manypoten-  tial reasons for the BBB to break, a simple m~l\\nof trau-  matic damage could account for the commoner sites of\\nlesions being in the highly mobile optic nerve and cervical  cord,\\nespecially when tethered by the dentate ligaments  [Oppenheimer\\'s\\n(1978) exact words], and the periventricu,  lar areas, particularly\\nthose where acute angles occur result-  ing in high shear stress\".  If\\none is willing to assume, as so many MS researchers  do, that many\\nsimilarities (although not identity)exist be-  tween EAE and MS, there\\ncan be no more convincing    SI1    Fig. 3.

From Clark and Bogdanove (1955).\\nReproduced with permission from the Journal of Neuropathology and\\nE.werirnental Neur-  oloKv.    example of the crucial role that can be\\nplayed by traumatic  injury to the BBB in facilitating the formation\\nof lesions  than the classic experiments of Clark and Bogdanove\\n(1955). They showed that the lesions of EAE, which are  usually\\ndisseminated throughout the white matter, could be  localized to an\\narea where the BBB had been previously  disrupted by an electrolytic\\nlesion (Fig. 3). Levine and  Hoenig (1968) did the same thing after\\nproducing a local  thermal injury to the BBB. It is unfortunately not\\npossible  at the present time to produce MRI-confirmed similar ex-\\namples of lesion localization in MS patients.  Because the degree of\\nvulnerability of the BBB undoubt-  edly varies from patient to patient\\nas well as from time to  time in individual patients, depending upon\\nmany factors  such as age, the duration of disease, the state of immu-\\nnological responsiveness, and other unknown factors, it is  as\\nunrealistic to expect every MS patient to have a clinical\\nexacerbation following trauma to head, neck or back as to  expect\\nevery individual to develop the Guillain-Barr6 syn-  drome or other\\nneurological illness after influenza vaccina-  tion. In fact, in\\nclinical practice it is not at all unusual to  have patients suffer\\ntrauma without any sequelae, and then  to have a later episode that is\\nfollowed by a serious exacer-  bation. In fact, Weintraub (1988)\\ncommenting on the fre-  quency with which MtlI lesions are seen in\\npatients who  have just become symptomatic in their twenties or\\nthirties,  suggests that these lesions might have resulted from many\\nminor childhood head and neck injuries. Matthews (1991),  although he\\nmay not have had trauma in mind, almost  echoed this when he said that\\nrepeated episodes of asymp-    tomatic breakdown of the BBB are\\nenvisaged as eventually  leading to demyelination and symptomatic\\nrelapse.    Notes on the progression of MS    Several years ago (Poser\\n1985) I suggested that MS was  a steadily progressive disease and that\\nexacerbations were  entirely dependent upon the clinical location and\\nsize of the  particular lesion. I suggested an analogy with the\\nHawaiian  Islands. The islands themselves representing clinical exac-\\nerbations, while the undersea volcanoes continued to have  activity\\nwhich was unseen and unsuspected. Serial MRI  studies have shown that\\nsorne \"lesions\" (i.e. areas of in-  creased signal intensity on long\\nTR images) may disappear  (Baum et al. 1985) whereas others may appear\\n(Johnson et  al. 1984; Uhlenbrock et al. 1989). Serial gadolinium en-\\nhanced MRIs have now confirmed this concept (Thompson  et al. 1991)\\n(Fig. 4).  It is important, however, to clearly differentiate between\\nthe progression of clinical manifestations and the progres-  sion of\\nthe disease itself, the latter potentially remaining  completely\\nasymptomatic for many years, possibly even for  the individual\\'s\\nentire life (Poser et al. 1992). There are a  number of mechanisms\\nthat can explain the progression of  clinical symptoms: for example,\\nthe scar resulting from the  glial response to demyelination may\\nactually extend beyond  the confines of the area from which myelin has\\nbeen lost,  thus causing more damage to the nervous system; as axons\\nbecome destroyed (as often happens in the center of all  lesions),\\nWallerian degeneration ensues, causing an increase    S12    in the\\nseverity of signs and symptoms. In regard to the  progression of the\\ndisease itself, regardless of its clinical  manifestations, the\\nproblem must, at least at this time, be  explained on a different\\nbasis. The simplest one is (Fig. 5)  that with activity of the disease\\nprocess, whether sympto-  matic or not, there is a decrease in the\\nsafety margin avail-  able for various myelinated systems within the\\nCNS. In  other words, the myelinated systems become increasingly\\nvulnerable as the safety margin becomes smaller and  smaller,\\neventually disappears completely, and irreversible  changes leading to\\npermanent signs and symptoms appear.  Obviously, the temporary\\nimpairment of the safety margin  or of the system itself may be caused\\nby edema and inflam-  mation which are reversible, but become\\npermanent once  myelin is destroyed. The evidence for fimctional\\nremyelina-  tion remains extremely unimpressive.  Another important\\nconsideration is that it has been  shown (Barnes et al. 1991), by\\nmeans of serial gadolinium-  enhanced MRIs that after alterations of\\nthe BBB, complete  repair does not always occur and that the normal\\nimperme-  ability of the BBB may not be restored for quite some time.\\nThey noted that in pathological examinations of MS brains  evidence of\\nactive inflammation is occasionally seen at the  margins of lesions\\nbut is usually absent within them. On the  other hand there is\\npathological evidence to suggest that a    MRI Activity  20  15  10  5\\n0    ~  m    EDSS    0  2  4  RelaOses    8  8  10 12 14  Time (weeks)\\n16 18 20 22 24    Fig. 4.

This figure was drawn by Dr. Glenn\\nRosen,  Harvard Medical School -- Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA.\\ndisturbance of BBB function continues to exist in these  lesions. They\\nhave studied some of these plaques by MR/  and concluded that the\\npossibility arose that a BBB defect  may persist in long-standing\\nlesions and be of pathogenetic  significance in the progression of the\\ndisease. Evidence of  BBB damage was found in 70% of lesions, was less\\nsevere  than that seen in acute lesions and may result from repeated\\nprevious inflammatory insults. The findings implied pro-  gressive\\naxonal loss in lesions as they age, accelerating the  progression of\\nthe disease.  What has not been determined with certainty from imag-\\ning studies in MS is whether a more subtle BBB defect  exists in long-\\nstanding lesions. In the present study, Barnes  et al. (1991) found a\\nslow, modest pattern of enhancement  in eight out of 53 lesions,\\ndistinct from the type seen in  acute lesions but similar to that\\npreviously reported in de-  myelinating cervical cord lesions. They\\nconcluded that \"the  type of enhancement seen in our eight lesions may\\nreflect a  noninflammatory BBB defect resulting from incomplete re-\\npair following repeated previous inflammatory insults. If, as  has\\nbeen suggested blood-borne disease mediators such as  complement are\\nimportant in MS, then a chronic BBB de-  fect of the kind we have\\nobserved might allow such media-  tors to diffuse through open lesions\\nand promote new in-  flammation at their myelinative margins, as is\\ncommonly  seen both pathologically and on MRI\".  It should also be\\nremembered that as was demonstrated  by Adams (1985) and by Gay and\\nEsiri (1992) inflamma-  tory changes can be seen in blood vessels in\\nnormal white  matter of MS patients and may then be considered to be\\n\"\\'at    risk\" for the formation of lesions.  The persistence of an\\nopen BBB obviously creates a  two-way street, since myelin abbau\\nsubstances such as  MBP, PLP, and MOG as well as other substances, may\\nleave  the CNS and enter the peripheral circulation, where they  may\\nactivate immunocompetent cells and humoral media-  tors. The\\npossibility also exists that there is a constant ex-  change of\\nimmunologically active or (inactive) substances  that may play a role\\nin either maintaining the alteration of  the BBB, or participating in\\nthe myelinoclastic process,  either directly or indirectly, by unknown\\nmeans. Whatever  the role of activated lymphocytes may be, this\\nscenario was  suggested by Zamvil and Steinman (1990). Oger et al.\\n(1988) and Davison (1992) made somewhat similar sugges-  tions. It is\\nextended here to include non-cellular elements.  What it really means\\nis that as long as the BBB remains  permeable, MS must be considered a\\nself-perpetuating dis-  ease. This indicates that a single event,\\nwhether it is an  infection, vaccination, trauma, or any other\\ntrigger, may  initiate a cascade of neuropathological events which\\nwill  results in progression of the disease itself as well as, in\\nmany instances, of its clinical manifestations. In other  words, there\\nis no way of knowing when and if a lesion  which resulted from the BBB\\nalteration that was caused by  a triggering episode and which remained\\nasymptomatic,  may at any time in the future, as a result of another\\ntrigger  (perhaps an insignificant viral infection) become sympto-\\nmatic (Fig. 5).  In this light, it is difficult to explain the fact\\nthat a  number of MS patients, in particular those who have suf-\\nfered from the disease for 15 or 20 years, quite often stabi-  lize,\\nso that the disease appears to be \"burned out\". This has  not yet been\\nconfirmed by serial MRI studies but certainly  appears to be so from\\nclinical observation. It is possible that  the blood-brain barrier\\neventually is restored to its imper-  meability, that the activity of\\nthe immune system quiets  down or that some other changes take place\\nwhich cause the  myelinoclastic mechanism to disappear.    Conclusions\\nMany unanswered questions and unexplained puzzling  observations\\nremain in terms of the exact pathogenesis of  MS. It is not\\nappropriate today to state that the etiology of  MS is unknown, a\\nconcept which does not apply here as it  does in bacterial pneumonia\\nor myocardial infarction. There  is no longer any doubt about the\\ninitiatory role of a non-spe-  cific viral infection or of a viral\\nantigen in producing a  systemic condition known as the MS trait. It\\nis now quite  well established that an alteration of the BBB is an\\nobliga-  tory step in the formation of the MS lesion in the CNS. This\\nlesion consists of edema and inflammation and may, but  need not, go\\non to demyelination. Several mechanisms can  lead to the increased BBB\\npermeability among which the    S13    most common are viral\\ninfections and concussional trauma,  although it is clear that these\\ntriggering events will not  necessarily result in changes in the CNS\\nin all cases or on  every occasion in the same patient. Evidence has\\nnow be-  come available which establishes that the BBB imperme-\\nability may not be fully restored and that cellular and hu-  moral\\nmediators may move in both directions across the  BBB; this would\\nimply that MS may be a self-perpetuating  disease process. The exact\\ncourse of events which results in  the actual destruction of the\\nmyelin sheath remains a mys-  tery.

Using dual-stain\\nimmunohistochemistry, we initially compared the ability of a mixture\\nof cytokines (IL-la, IL-l IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, TNF- IFN-/3 and\\nIFN-y) with that of physical stimuli such as heat shock and peroxide,\\nto increase cellular expression of the mainly inducible hsp72 species\\nin mixed glial cell cultures (containing ODC, astrocytes and\\nmicroglia). Similar to heat shock and peroxide, the cytokine mixture\\ninduced hsp72 expression only in ODC (70 t 5% vs. a baseline of 3 t 1%\\npositive cells). When used individually, however, only IL-la (79 t\\n3%), IFN-y (70 t 2%) and TNF-a (65 f 5%) induced ODC hsp72 expression\\nin mixed glial cell cultures. In purified ODC preparations, only IL-la\\ninduced hsp72 expression (84 f 4%). An IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-\\nlra), abrogated hsp72 induction by IL-la (16 t 3%) as well as that due\\nto IFN-y (14 f 1%) and TNF-a (13 t 2%) in mixed glial cell cultures.\\nFurthermore, ODC express IL-1 receptors, detected by confocal laser\\nscanning microscopy. Our data indicate that cytokines mediate hsp\\ninduction in ODC possibly via a final common pathway involving IL-1\\nbinding to its receptor on ODC. Such interaction could enhance any\\nputative ODC-immune interactions which are dependent on hsp molecule\\nrecognition.

Introduction     Multiple sclerosis (MS)\\nis an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system\\n(CNS) characterized by multifocal inflammatory lesions containing\\nperivascular infiltrates of T cells, B cells and macrophages, in which\\ndestruction of the oligodendrocyte (013C)-myelin unit is seen\\n(Prineas, 1985; Calder et al., 1989; Hafler et al., 1989), possibly as\\nan early event (Rodriguez et al., 1993). The antigen that induces or\\nperpetuates the presumed autoimmune response is as yet unknown. The\\ntarget of the immunemediated destruction, the ODC-myelin unit,\\nexpresses neither MHC class I nor MHC class II proteins (Grenier et\\nal., 1989; Raine, 1991), raising the possibil-    * Corresponding\\nauthor.

All rights reserved  SSDI0165-5728(93)E0148-3    ity that\\nthe immune injury might be mediated by effector T cells that are\\ncapable of MHC unrestricted or antigen non-specific interaction, such\\nas promiscuous cytotoxic aT cells or y8-T cells (De Vries et al.,\\n1989; Ruijs et al., 1993).   y8-T cells have been detected within MS\\nplaques (Selmaj et al., 1991a; Wucherpfennig et al., 1992) in\\nassociation with hsp-expressing ODC (Selmaj et al., 1991b). Hsp have\\nbeen postulated to serve as recognition molecules for y8-T cells\\n(Haregewoin et al., 1989; Indreshpal et al., 1993), and as such, may\\nserve to regulate the number and activity of y8-T cell infiltrates in\\nMS plaques; hsp-expressing target cells in vitro, including ODC, have\\nbeen shown to induce proliferation of y8-T cells (Freedman et al.,\\n1991a). y8-T cells have been shown to be lytic to adult human-derived\\nODC in vitro (Freedman et al., 1991b) suggesting that the y8-T cells\\ngaining entry into the brain white matter  18    Sameer D. D'Souza et\\nal. /Journal of Neuroimmunology 50 (1994) 17-24    may be deleterious\\nto the ODC-myelin unit and thus may contribute to the pathogenesis of\\nMS.   Since the expression of hsp in ODC could be the `rate-limiting\\nstep' for y8-T cell-ODC interaction, we examined the possible role of\\ncytokines, found in elevated levels in the inflammatory milieu of MS\\nplaque tissue (Hofmann et al., 1986; Hofmann et al., 1989; Selmaj et\\nal., 1991c), in regulating hsp expression in human ODC. We found that\\ncytokines can mediate hsp expression in ODC and that IL-1 may play a\\ncritical role in this process, probably through interaction with its\\nreceptor on ODC.    2. Materials and methods    2.1. Mixed glial and\\npurified ODC cell cultures     Human brain tissue was obtained from\\nsix different epilepsy patients undergoing surgical treatment. Mixed\\nglial cells consisting of ODC, astrocytes and microglia were isolated\\nas previously described (Yong and Antel, 1992) and suspended in DMEM\\n(Gibco, Canada) supplemented with penicillin 2.5 U/ ml, streptomycin\\n2.5 A,g/ml, glutamine 2 mM and 5% FCS (all from Gibco Canada). Mixed\\nglial cells consisting of approximately 70% ODC, 25% microglia and 5%\\nastrocytes were plated onto poly-L-lysine (10 A,g/ml; Sigma, St.\\nLouis, MO)-coated coverslips at a density of 1-5 x 104 cells per\\ncoverslip, placed in Nuntron Petri dishes (Gibco, Canada) containing\\nDMEM supplemented with 5% AB' NHS (Pel-freeze, WI) and maintained in a\\n5% COZ humidified 37 incubator. Purified ODC cultures (> 90% CNPase+)\\nwere prepared by gently shaking mixed glial cell cultures and\\nreplating the less adherent, floating ODC onto poly-L-lysine coated\\ncoverslips (Yong and Antel, 1992).    2.2. Cytokines, antibodies and\\nother reagents     Recombinant human (rh) IL-la, IL-1/3, IL-2, IL-8,\\nTNF-a and TNF-(LT) were obtained from Intermedico Diagnostics\\n(Markham, Ontario); rh IL-6 from Immunex Corp. (Seattle, WA); rh IFN-\\nfrom Berlex (Alameda, CA); rh IFN-y from Boehringer Mannheim (Laval,\\nQuebec) and hydrogen peroxide from Fischer (Fair Lawn, NJ). The human\\nIL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-Ira was supplied by Synergen (Boulder,\\nCO) and the IL-1 receptor antibody was obtained from Immunex Corp.\\n(Seattle, WA). The following primary antibodies (Ab) were used:\\npolyclonal rabbit anti-cow CNPase (2'3' cyclic nucleotide\\nphosphodiesterase) Ab that cross-reacts with the human protein, as a\\nmarker for ODC (a gift of Dr. P. Braun; McGill University, Montreal)\\n(Freedman et al., 1992), polyclonal rabbit anti-cow GFAP (glial\\nfibrillary acidic protein) Ab that    recognizes the human protein, as\\na marker for astrocytes (Dakopatts, Denmark) and mouse anti-human\\nhsp72 IgGI mAb (Amersham; Oakville, Ontario) specific for the\\ninducible hsp72 species, but not the constitutive hsc 70 species.\\nSecondary Ab included rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit mAb\\n(OrganonTeknika; Scarborough, Ontario) and goat anti-mouseFITC (TAGO;\\nBurlingame, CA).    2.3. Induction of hsp72 in oligodendrocytes\\nMixed glial cells or purified ODC were cultured on coverslips and\\nplaced into individual wells of 24-well Nuntron (Becton Dickinson;\\nMountain View, CA) plates containing culture medium alone or the\\nindicated stimuli: IL-la, IL-l IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, TNF-/3, IFN-\\nand IFN-y, individually, each at a concentration of 1 U/ ml, 10 U/ ml,\\n100 U/ ml or 1000 U/ ml, or as a mixture, each at a concentration of\\n1000 U/ ml, or hydrogen peroxide (400 mM). As a positive control, some\\ncoverslips containing mixed glial cells or purified ODC were heat\\nshocked for 30 min in a water bath preheated to 43 (37 for negative\\ncontrol) as previously described (Freedman et al., 1992). All\\ntreatments except heat shock were carried out for 18 h in a 5% COZ\\nhumidified 37 incubator.    2.4. Inhibition of cytokine-mediated\\ninduction of hsp72 by the IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-Ira     In some\\ncases, coverslips containing mixed glial cells or purified ODC were\\npretreated for 4 h with 10 g.g/ml of IL-Ira (Dinarello and Thompson,\\n1991) and treated as above. This concentration represents a 500fold\\nexcess relative to 2000 U/ml of IL-la (Dinarello and Thompson, 1991;\\nDinarello, 1991; Kent et al., 1992).    2.5. Double\\nimmunohistochemistry     ODC were identified using rabbit anti-cow\\nCNPase Ab (1:100) followed by rhodamine-conjugated antirabbit IgG\\nsecondary Ab (1:100); astrocytes, using rabbit anti-cow GFAP Ab\\n(1:100) followed by rhodamine-labelled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100);\\nmicroglia, based on their bipolar morphology and lack of either GFAP\\nor CNPase staining. Hsp72 expression was detected by double staining\\nwith anti-human hsp72 Ab (1:500) followed by goat anti-mouse FITC\\nsecondary Ab (1:40). Isotype control studies included use of an\\nirrelevant IgGI mAb. All analyses were performed using a Reichert\\nPolyvar 2 Leica immunofluorescence microscope.   To detect IL-1\\nreceptors on the ODC plasma membrane, purified ODC as well as mixed\\nglial cell cultures were stained as described above for CNPase\\nfollowed  Sameer D. D'Souza et al. /Journal of Neuroimmunology 50\\n(1994) 17-24    by mouse anti-human IL-1R IgGt (1:50) (a generous gift\\nfrom Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA) and goat antimouse FITC (1: 40) and\\nanalysed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica\\nLasertechnik, Heidelberg, Germany). Isotype controls were also\\nincluded in these studies. Samples were scanned with a 40 X 1.3 NA oil\\nimmersion objective with a band pass filter peaking at 535 t 7 nm for\\nFITC specificity and a 580 nm high pass filter for rhodamine.   For\\neach experiment, 600-1200 ODC, 40-80 astrocytes and 100-200 microglia\\nover four coverslips were counted by an observer blinded to the\\ntreatment received by the cells and the number of cells positive for\\nhsp72 was determined and expressed as a percentage of the total number\\nof cells counted f SD.    3. Results    3.1. Hsp72 expression in mixed\\nglial cell cultures: comparison of cytokines to physical inducing\\nagents     In keeping with our previous data (Freedman et al., 1992),\\nwe found that at basal temperatures (37), few    TREATMENT    CYTOKINE\\nPANEL    H202    HEAT SHOCK    19    non-treated ODC and no astrocytes\\nor microglia expressed detectable hsp72 (Fig. 1; Fig. 4a, b). After\\nphysical heat shock (43), hsp72 expression was observed only in the\\nODC with little or no expression in microglia or astrocytes (Fig. 1;\\nFig. 4c, d). Other physical stimuli, such as hydrogen peroxide (400\\nmM), gave similar results (Fig. 1). Using a panel of nine cytokines\\n(IL-la, IL-l IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, TNF-/3, IFN-/9 and IFN-y), each\\ncytokine within the mixture at a concentration of 1000 U/ ml, we found\\nthat, similar to the results of physical stimuli such as heat shock\\nand hydrogen peroxide, upregulation of hsp72 expression was observed\\nonly in the ODC (Fig. 1).    3.2.

Cytokine-mediated\\ninduction of hsp72 in purified ODC cultures     In order to determine\\nwhether IL-la, IFN-y or TNF-a directly induced hsp72 in ODC, we re-\\ntested each of the cytokines on purified ODC cultures at 1 U/ ml, 10\\nU/ ml, 100 U/ ml and 1000 U/ ml. Only IL-1 a retained the ability to\\ninduce hsp72 in the ODC. Treatment with IL-la at 1000 U/ ml, but not\\nat lower concentrations (1-100 U/ ml; data not shown) resulted in an\\nincrease in the number of hsp-expressing ODC compared to non-treated\\ncells (Fig. 2); at higher concentrations (2000 U/ ml), hsp72 induction\\nin ODC (Fig. 2; Fig. 4e, f) quantitatively matched the results\\nobtained by heat shock and peroxide treatment (Fig. 1). However, IL-\\nldid not induce hsp72 at 1000 U/ ml (Fig. 2) or 2000 U/ ml (data not\\nshown).    3.4. Competitive inhibition of cytokine-mediated HSP72\\ninduction in ODC by the IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-Ira     To\\ndetermine whether IL-la-mediated hsp72 induction in purified ODC and\\nmixed filial cell cultures was    due to the binding of IL-1a to its\\nreceptor on ODC, IL-lra, a specific IL-1 receptor antagonist was used\\nat the recommended concentration for in vitro studies (Dinarello,\\n1991; Dinarello and Thompson, 1991; Kent et al., 1992). IL-lra blocked\\nhsp72 induction in the purified ODC (Fig. 3; Fig. 4g, h). Since IL-1a\\nwas the only cytokine that induced hsp72 in purified ODC, we\\nconsidered that TNF-a or IFN-y-mediated hsp72 induction in the mixed\\nfilial cell cultures possibly operated through a final common pathway\\nwhich involved IL-la. To test this hypothesis, IL-lra was included in\\nthe TNF-a and IFN-y experiments on mixed filial cell cultures. Similar\\nto the results found using purified ODC, IL-lra substantially blocked\\nTNF-a and IFN-yinduced ODC hsp72 expression (Fig. 3).    3.5.

These findings suggest that all agents\\nwhich are toxic to ODC do not necessarily invoke hsp expression.\\nElevated levels of cytokines in MS lesions may derive from activated T\\ncells, monocytes, astrocytes or microglia (Hintzon et al., 1992). IL-\\nla, TNF-a and IFN-y in particular, have been postulated to play an\\nactive role in the ongoing disease process in MS: they have been\\nimplicated in the induction of ODC death by apoptosis (TNF-a) (Noble\\net al., 1992); MHC II upregulation on macrophages, microglia and\\nastrocytes (IFN-y) (Wong et al., 1984; Fierz et al., 1985; Benveniste\\net a,1989); upregulation of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells of\\nCNS blood vessels (IFN-y, TNF-a) (Male et al., 1990); astrogliosis\\n(IL-1, TNF-a) (Merrill, 1991); release of prostoglandin EZ (IL-1,\\nTNF-a) (Bernheim, 1986); induction of fever (IL-1) (Merrill, 1991);\\nand stimulating cytotoxicity of macrophages and microglia (IFN-y)\\n(Hartung et al., 1990; Zielasek et al., 1992).

In vitro, IL-1 has been\\nshown to induce hsp70 in rat pancreatic islets (Helqvist et al.,\\n1991), bovine chondrocytes (Cruz et al., 1991), as well as murine\\ncardiac myocytes (Low-Friedrich et al., 1992). In all these diseases,\\npart of the pathological process and chronicity has been linked to the\\nincreased number of T cells and antibodies reactive with the elevated\\nlevels of hsp. Hsp-reactive y8-T cells have been implicated in many\\nchronic autoimmune diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis,\\ndiabetes and systemic lupus erythematosis (Holoshitz, 1990). Hsp-\\nresponsive y8-T cells have been isolated from the synovial fluid of\\nrheumatoid arthritis patients (Holoshitz et al., 1989). With regard to\\nMS, it is intriguing to postulate that cytokine induction of hsp in\\nODC leads to enhanced, probably deleterious interactions between y8-T\\ncells and ODC.   In vivo, IL-1a is for the most part a membrane-\\nexpressed cytokine (Dinarello and Wolff, 1993), which may be\\ndirectionally focused onto its receptors on target cells. This highly\\nefficient juxtacrine signalling may thus result in very high local\\ncytokine concentrations. The use of large doses of cytokines are\\ntherefore justified in our experiments, in order to reproduce in vitro\\neffects comparable to those described in vivo.   Hsp72 was used as a\\nmodel for studying hsp induction in ODC because it is a mainly\\ninducible species which is minimally expressed constitutively\\n(Freedman et al., 1992). Following induction, cells become brightly\\nSameer D. D'Souza et al. /Journal of Neuroimmunology 50 (1994) 17-24\\n23    immunoreactive with anti-hsp antibody, facilitating the\\nquantitation of hsp72+ cells. Other hsp, e.g. hsp65 upregulate their\\nexpression following the same stimuli which induce hsp72; however,\\nbecause they are constitutively expressed in ODC (Satoh et al.,\\n1992b), it would be difficult to distinguish the upregulation using\\nthe double immunohistochemistry technique described here. Flow\\ncytometry could ideally be used for this, but is not possible owing to\\nthe paucity of glial cells. Our results with hsp72 are therefore\\nprobably applicable to other hsp.   The ability of IL-lra to\\neffectively block IL-1 cell surface receptors without triggering\\ncellular responses typical of IL-1 as well as its biological\\ninactivity (Dinarello and Thompson, 1991) makes it an attractive agent\\nfor clinical use. Recombinant IL-lra is presently in clinical trials\\nfor treating several inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid\\narthritis, septic shock, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma and graft-\\nversushost disease (Dinarello and Thompson, 1991). The demonstration\\nthat IL-lra blocks IL-1-mediated induction of hsp72 in ODC in vitro\\nsuggests that if a similar effect could be achieved in vivo, then it\\nmight be possible to decrease hsp expression in ODC of MS plaques and\\nhence dampen putatively harmful ODCimmune interactions which are\\ndependent on hsp molecule recognition, such as those possibly\\ninvolving y8-T cells.

       " \"The function of the intracellular protein 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP) of oligodendrocytes (ODC) is unknown. We have now generated several homozygous transgenic mouse lines in which the human CNP gene is overexpressed up to sixfold, revealing new insights into early stages of myelinogenesis. Although no behavioral phenotype is immediately apparent, abnormalities of ODC and their myelin sheaths are striking. These are manifested as redundant myelin membrane and intramyelinic vacuoles, as well as lack of myelin compaction concordant with failure of the cytoplasmic leaflets of compact myelin to fuse. Further, ODC that overexpress CNP appear to mature earlier in development, resulting in earlier maximum gene expression for myelin basic proteins and proteolipid protein. These results indicate that CNP is an early expressed regulator of cellular events that culminate in CNS myelination.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Following inflammatory insults to white matter of the central nervous system (CNS), frequently myelin is poorly repaired in both humans and animals. This deficit in remyelination contributes to axonal dysfunction and associated neurological disability in multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common syndrome of inflammatory demyelination in humans. In MS and similar diseases, the inflammatory response is associated with damage of oligodendrocytes (ODC) and myelin (reviewed in  Hunter and Rodriguez, 1995 ). A number of histologically similar diseases of animals are of viral origin. One naturally occurring picornavirus, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), causes a slowly progressive myelopathy associated with inflammatory demyelinating lesions in spinal cord and brainstem (susceptibility and pathogenesis reviewed in  Rodriguez et al., 1987b ). This well-characterized mouse model of progressive MS has been useful in the study of immunological processes underlying CNS demyelination. More recently our laboratory has employed this model to study the promotion of myelin repair by immunological and pharmacological interventions (reviewed in  Miller and Rodriguez, 1995b ).\\nThe identification of the critical targets and possible mechanisms of action has been formidable, principally due to polyspecificity of SCH 94.03 and other RPA. One possible action is directly on the ODC. Immunohistochemical studies are complicated since monoclonal RPA react with intracellular antigens in most tissues. In the CNS, astrocytes, ependyma, microglia and ODCs are stained intracellularly ( Miller et al., 1996b ). Despite the reactivity with intracellular antigens of both CNS and other organs, antibody action is more likely determined by its cell surface reactivity. Neonatal mouse ODC cultures (3 weeks in vitro) contain morphologically mature ODC with punctate, cell-surface staining for SCH 94.03. About 50% of SCH 94.03-reactive ODC also express myelin basic protein, a marker of more mature ODC. However, SCH 94.03 does not react with ODC lipids or resemble the developmental and antigenic reactivity of the common ODC lineage markers ( Asakura et al., 1996a ). Thus, the issue has become, do biologically significant quantities of SCH 94.03 and other RPA reach and react with ODC in and near demyelinated lesions?\\nIn  35 S-SCH 94.03 antibody-treated animals, radiolabel localized to ODC, outer faces of myelin sheaths, and inner glial loop or axolemma; the internal lamellae of the myelin sheath were labeled in degenerating sheaths only. Heavily labeled areas were always associated with demyelination and perivascular inflammatory infiltrates; these lesions (17±4%) had an intense signal associated with degenerated myelin sheaths, persisting ODC, and inner margin of the pial surface. Most (75±4%) demyelinated lesions labeled less intensely in a pattern associated with myelin or glia (consistent with ODC), and only 8% showed no labeling. By the same criteria, autoradiographic control sections showed only 3% of lesions with any pial signal, 22% labeled sparsely, and 75% showed no grains at all. Moreover, control sections showed no heavily labeled parenchymal areas.\\nWe selected regions from the most heavily radiolabeled, demyelinated spinal cord lesions for further quantitative study by ultrastructural autoradiography ( Fig. 4 \\n                         ). Glial or axonal structures were labeled by 92% of observed silver grains. Although myelin and ODC had a similar cross-sectional area to axoplasm in our sampling (51% myelin and ODC, 49% axoplasm), silver grains ( n =22) were more likely to be found ( χ \\n                         2 ,  P <0.01) on ODC or myelin (81%) than the axoplasm (18%). Silver grains in contact with myelin or ODC were over the inner glial loop or axolemma (61%), outer myelin sheath (33%), or an ODC process (33%). Only 12% of grains labeling ODC were found solely over the myelin sheath proper.\\nThe association of radiolabeled SCH 94.03 with the membranes of CNS cells and myelin extends prior observations that this polyspecific, natural autoantibody reacts with a subset of well-differentiated ODC in vitro ( Asakura et al., 1996a ). Others have used  35 S isotopes to label the structures of the extracellular space and find a similar resolution for  35 S to less energetic  3 H, possibly due to the more energetic particles exiting the emulsion without reacting ( Brown et al., 1969 ). Ultrastructural autoradiography employs sections and emulsions approaching infinite thinness, permitting a half distance of about 200 nm; grain density is highest over the source and falls off exponentially ( Rogers, 1979 ). Our analysis of the pattern of reactivity suggests that labeled antibody enters the extracellular space and reacts with the outer surface of the ODC, myelin, and the inner glial loop or axolemma.\\nRemyelination-promoting antibodies, including mAb SCH 94.03, could promote myelin repair in part by interacting directly with ODC or myelin. Since demyelinated lesions accumulate over many months in these mice, the minority of heavily labeled lesions are likely to be those which have recent inflammation and BBB breakdown. Chronically demyelinated areas without perivascular infiltration probably have a relatively intact BBB, as they do in MS ( Traugott, 1987 ), and therefore have lesser amounts of radiolabel. Even in the case of relatively permeable malignant tumors with large quantities of a target antigen, a high uptake of antibody over 7 days is 0.01% of total antibody dose, which is a 3–40-fold concentration relative to other tissues ( Reilly et al., 1995 ).\\nAlthough SCH 94.03 can enter the CNS and associate with ODC in chronically TMEV-infected mice, the manner in which antibody binding promotes repair of CNS myelin is unknown. Even though antibodies have traditionally been assigned to a role in neutralizing and opsonizing infectious agents, other roles have been found including direct modification of ODC behavior in vitro ( Benjamins and Dyer, 1990 ). Antibodies to spinal cord or white matter can stimulate myelin component synthesis ( Lehrer et al., 1979 ) or division of rat ODC progenitors in vitro ( Rodriguez et al., 1987a ). Antibodies against ODC membrane lipids or proteins can modulate membrane components, cell structure, intracellular calcium, and ODC progenitor maturation ( Bansal et al., 1988 ;  Dyer and Benjamins 1988, 1991 ;  Bansal and Pfeiffer, 1989 ;  Cohen et al., 1990 ;  Dyer et al., 1991 ).\\nMore traditional actions of antibodies may indeed be important for remyelination. Complement fixation could clear injured or dead ODC in regions of demyelination, improving the substrate for repair by glial progenitor cells or persisting ODC. Possibly, complete clearance of injured, mature ODC from a demyelinated region may be required for efficient remyelination. ODC progenitor proliferation in vitro is impaired by high cell density, becoming down-regulated following differentiation of ODC ( Hunter and Bottenstein 1989, 1990, 1991 ). Finally, agglutination and opsonization of debris from ODC, myelin, and axons could increase the efficiency of phagocytosis, thereby limiting secondary cellular infiltration, minimizing immune activation to cryptic neural antigens, and protecting surviving white matter elements from further immune injury.\\nPotential mechanisms are not limited to purely an effect on the ODC. Indeed, most antibody remains outside the CNS and could have immunomodulatory activity. Exogenous Ig modulates the immune response in a number of human and animal immune diseases in an incompletely understood and probably multifactorial fashion. Natural autoantibodies such as SCH 94.03 have been proposed to have an immunomodulatory action ( Avrameas and Ternynck, 1993 ). Treatment of TMEV-infected mice decreases infiltration of T-lymphocytes into the CNS by 2–3-fold and impairs humoral immune responses to T-cell-dependent antigens ( Miller et al., 1996a ). Interleukin-2, produced by infiltrating CD4 +  T-cells during the inflammatory response, can impair proliferation of ODC progenitors of the mature brain phenotype ( Hunter and Bottenstein, 1990 ). Systemic actions of the antibody might occur through an anti-idiotypic antibody network or by binding with specific immune cells. SCH 94.03 binds the dendritic cells of the thymus which are crucial for T-cell development ( Miller et al., 1996b ).\\n\",\n",
       " 'Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is inherently invasive, and it is from the invasive cell population that the tumor recurs. The GBM invasion transcriptome reveals over-expression of various autocrine factors that could act as motility drivers, such as autotaxin (ATX). Some of these factors could also have paracrine roles, modulating the behavior of cells in the peri-tumoral brain parenchyma. ATX generates lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which signals through LPA receptors expressed by GBM as well as in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes (ODC) and microglia; their activation manifest cell specific effects. ATX stimulates invasion of GBM cells in vitro and ex vivo invasion assays. ATX activity enhances GBM adhesion in cells expressing the LPA1 receptor, as well as stimulating rac activation. GBM secreted ATX can also have paracrine effects: ATX activity results in reduced ODC adhesion. ODC monolayer invasion showed that U87 and U251 GBM cells expressing ATX invaded through an ODC monolayer significantly more than cells depleted of ATX or cells expressing inactive ATX, suggesting that GBM cells secreting ATX find ODCs less of a barrier than cells that do not express ATX. Secreted factors that drive GBM invasion can have autocrine and paracrine roles; one stimulates GBM motility and the other results in ODC dis-adhesion.\\n',\n",
       " \"Animal models of multiple sclerosis-Potentials and limitations.\\nTrials to investigate pathogenetic, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of multiple sclerosis (MS) in animal models date back to the first half of the 20th century (Lindsey, 2005) (Fig. 1) . Before, Louis Pasteur's rabies vaccination (Pasteur and Illo, 1996) gave first hints to the possibility that immunization of humans with xenogenic nervous tissue induces ascending paralysis. Specifically, inoculation of rabies patients with desiccated spinal cord of rabiesinfected rabbits caused pareses of limb, neck and facial muscles resulting in gait, swallowing and breathing problems (Baxter, 2007) . Conversely, it was shown by Koritschoner and Schweinburg (1925) and Stuart and Krikorian (1928) that injection of human spinal cord or sheep brain into rabbits leads to limb paralysis (clumsy gait and muscle weakness). Rivers et al. (1933) first demonstrated in monkeys immunized with rabbit brain or brain extracts that paralysis was associated with perivascular infiltrates and demyelination in the brain and spinal cord. He called the disease acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, a term that was later changed to experimental allergic or autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Since the frequency and severity of paralyses was correlated to the titer of anti-brain antibodies, researchers in subsequent trials boosted the humoral immune response with Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (Freund and McDermott, 1942) , later complemented by pertussis toxin (Munoz et al., 1984) . Thereby they could induce oscillatory symptoms and relapsing-remitting courses of the disease accompanied by perivascular leukocyte infiltration in acute lesions and gliosis in chronic lesions both reminiscent of MS pathology . Experiments were performed first in guinea pigs (Freund et al., 1947) and monkeys Morgan, 1947; Wolf et al., 1947) and later in various other species including mice (Olitzky and Yager, 1949) and rats (Lipton and Freund, 1952 ) enabling more extensive immunogenetic, histopathological and therapeutic studies. It turned out that the histopathology and the clinical course of the disease varied significantly reflecting in part the heterogeneity of its human counterpart dependent on the genetic background of the animals, the source of the antigenic material and the mode of application of the antigen Olsson et al., 2000; Wekerle et al., 1994) .\\nImportantly, by stepwise reduction of the complexity of the antigenic material from crude brain tissue and protein extracts through various central myelin proteins such as (i) myelin basic protein (MBP) (Einstein et al., 1962; Laatsch et al., 1962) , (ii) myelin oligodendrocyte (ODC) glycoprotein (MOG) (Lebar et al., 1986) , (iii) proteolipid protein (PLP) (Tuohy et al., 1988) , (iv) myelin-associated oligodendrocytic basic protein and 2 0 ,3 0cyclic nucleotide 3 0 -phosphodiesterase (Mä ä ttä et al., 1998) to small encephalitogenic peptides (Eylar et al., 1970; Lennon et al., 1970) such as MBP 1-37 , MBP 1-11 , MBP 1-9 , MBP 83-99 , MOG and PLP 139-151 , more reproducible EAE models became available that mirror different features of MS (Wekerle et al., 1994) . More recently a variety of additional antigens have been supposed to be involved in autoimmune reaction in MS and EAE ( Table 1) . Some of them are myelin constituents such as neurofascin NF 155 (Mathey et al., 2007) , others are expressed on myelin and axons such as contactin-2/transient axonal glycoprotein-1 (TAG-1) (Derfuss et al., 2009 ) and some are entirely non-myelin antigens such as the neuronal membrane protein neurofascin NF 186 (Mathey et al., 2007) , the neuronal cytoskeletal protein neurofilament-M and the astrocyte-typical Ca 2+ -binding protein S100b (Kojima et al., 1997) . The neurofascins NF 155 and NF 186 and the adhesion molecule contactin-2/TAG-1have been identified as putative MS auto-antigens by a proteomics-based screening approach of MS sera and were subsequently shown to promote the autoimmune pathogenesis of EAE in rat models (Derfuss et al., 2009 (Derfuss et al., , 2010 Mathey et al., 2007) . Antibodies to neurofascins, in particular to NF 186, caused axonal injury without enhancing inflammation and demyelination in MOG-EAE (Mathey et al., 2007) . In contrast to MOG-EAE, contactin-2/TAG-1-specific T cells induced inflammatory lesions preferentially in the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord white and gray matter (Derfuss et al., 2009) . However, while these cells were unable to cause demyelination by themselves they opened the blood-brain barrier (BBB) thereby allowing access of anti-MOG antibodies to the central nervous system (CNS) where they could trigger demyelin-ation. The EAE variants induced by axonal antigens may reflect special features of MS subtypes, e.g. those characterized by cortical lesions or by histological patterns II and IV according to the classification of Lucchinetti et al. (2000) . The schematic drawing in Fig. 2 indicates the molecular localisation of currently known putative auto-antigens in EAE. Proteins, glycoproteins and lipoproteins possessing encephalitogenic epitopes may be exposed to the outer surface of ODCs (1) or myelin (2) or they may reside in the compact myelin zone (3), at the myelin-axon interface (4) or the node of Ranvier (5). As to the last localisation the three adhesion molecules NF 155 and NF 186 contactin-2/TAG-1 are differentially expressed. Whereas NF 155 is localised at the paranodal myelin loop and interact with contactin-1/F3 and the contactin-associated protein 2 (caspr 2) on the axoplasm in a ternary complex (Charles et al., 2002) , NF 186 is exposed in the non-myelinated part of the node of Ranvier and interacts with the neuron-glia-related cell adhesion molecule (NrCAM) and voltagegated Na + channels (Hedstrom et al., 2007) . Contactin-2/TAG-1 is also expressed juxtaparanodal by both the myelin and axonal membrane forming dimers or molecular zippers (Mö rtl et al., 2007; Shimoda and Watanabe, 2009) . Whether lipids, glycolipids and phospholipids play also a role as auto-antigens in EAE and MS is not clear, although several evidences from experimental and clinical studies support such a role (Podbielska and Hogan, 2009) . Candiate myelin lipid auto-antigens in MS and/or EAE are shown in Table 1 . In a lipid microarray study of Kanter et al. (2006) coimmunization with sulfatides and co-application of sulfatidespecific antibodies worsened the clinical course of PLP 139-151 -EAE in SJL/J mice, and Quintana et al. (2008b) found auto-antibodies to lipids such as oxidized cholesterol derivatives in the serum of MS patients with the immunopathologic pattern II according to Lucchinetti et al. (2000) . However, the oxidized cholesterol derivatives did not affect the specific humoral and T cell response in MOG 55-75 -EAE.\\nSeveral studies have shown that actively induced EAE models can reproduce the typical temporal maturation of MS lesions from inflammation with or without deposition of immunoglobulin through demyelination and axonal damage to gliosis and partial remyelination. However, special phenotypes of MS pathology such as primary neuronal degeneration, shift of CD4 + T helper cells to CD8 + cytotoxic T cells and lesions in cortical areas are rarely reproduced by actively induced EAE models (Aktas et al., 2007; Gold et al., 2006; Herrero-Herranz et al., 2008; Linker et al., 2005; Pomeroy et al., 2005) . Hitherto it is not clear to which extent cortical lesions account for the brain atrophy in MS. Merkler et al. (2006) could induce focal demyelinating lesions in the cortex of MOG-EAE rats by stereotactical injection of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interferon-g (IFNg). Corresponding to findings in MS the focal cortical lesions were rapidly remyelinated. Accordingly, in marmoset MOG-EAE focal cortical lesions were not the major cause of diffuse cortical atrophy (Pomeroy et al., 2008) . The potential pathomechanisms of CNS atrophy in MS are complex and may include several mechanisms of neuronal damage such as anterograde Wallerian degeneration, neuronal dying-back and neuronal soma and dendritic shrinkage (Dziedzic et al., 2010; Siffrin et al., 2010) . Currently, disclosure of the exact mechanisms of axon damage is a major challenge of MS research, since it appears to be the main cause of clinical disability and may be the result of immune and/or non-immune attacks on neurons rather than a consequence of immune-mediated demyelination (Siffrin et al., 2010) .\\nConcerning the aetiopathogenesis of MS the role of infections is still a matter of controversy. In mice lymphocytic choriomenigitis virus protein expression could elicit chronic autoimmune inflammation and demyelination in the CNS (Evans et al., 1996) . A Chlamydia pneumonia-specific peptide sharing an immunodominant epitope with MBP-induced severe clinical and histological EAE (Lenz et al., 2001) , whereas intestinal parasites conveyed resistance to EAE in EAE-susceptible Lewis rats (Zorzella et al., 2007) . Also, human herpes virus type 6, Epstein-Barr virus, measles virus and retroviruses have been implicated in the aetiopathogenesis of MS, but currently available experimental and clinical data are not convincing enough to justify anti-viral or antibiotic therapy in MS. However, experimental demyelinating diseases induced by Theiler's virus (Theiler, 1934; Ure and Rodriguez, 2005) , coronavirus (Lavi, 2005) or canine distemper virus (Seehusen and Baumgä rtner, 2010) are suitable models for the investigation of some aspects of MS pathology. Increased antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with MS and optic neuritis Matà et al. (1999) Lactosylceramide and L-a-lysophosphatidylserine Strong antibody reactivity in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients Kanter et al. (2006) , Quintana et al. (2008b) Milestones of the development of increasingly specific EAE models were ( Fig. 1 ):\\n(i) Induction of EAE by transfer of total lymph node cells (Paterson, 1960) , isolated MBP-specific T cell-line cells (Ben-Nun et al., 1981) or interleukin-23 (IL-23)-dependent PLP-specific CD4 + T helper IL-17 (Th17) cells (Langrish et al., 2005) into naive rats or mice, respectively, establishing distinct forms of adoptive transfer EAE (AT-EAE) and (ii) generation of transgenic mice with deletion (knock-out leading to loss-of-function) or over-expression (knock-in leading to gain of function) of pathogenetically relevant genes (reviewed in Krishnamoorthy et al., 2007) . Examples of such genes are those encoding T cell receptors (TCRs) (Bettelli et al., 2006; Goverman et al., 1993; Lafaille et al., 1994; Mendel et al., 2004) , major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (Friese et al., 2008; Khare et al., 2005; Linker et al., 2005; Mangalam et al., 2008) , cytokines (reviewed in Campbell et al., 1998; Owens et al., 2001) as well as neurotrophic factors (Linker et al., 2005 (Linker et al., , 2008a (Linker et al., , 2009b Mirowska-Guzel, 2009 ) and their receptors (Dallenga et al., 2009; Linker et al., 2009b) .\\nThe constitutive knock-out or knock-in of cytokine genes throughout the whole development and adulthood of an animal implies serious drawbacks due to redundancy and feed-back loops of cytokine signal pathways (Owens et al., 2001; Steinman, 1997) . This constraint can been overcome by approaches with inducible spatially and temporally restricted gene targeting, which has been only recently introduced for studies directed to the CNS (Gavé riaux- Ruff and Kieffer, 2007; Hö velmeyer et al., 2005) .\\nDespite the obvious importance of autoimmune processes in the pathogenesis of MS, there is evidence for a non-immune origin of at least some subtypes of MS. For example, even aggressive immunosuppression is not sufficient to treat progressive MS. Therefore, additional experimental models are needed, especially for the study of non-immune-mediated demyelination and axonal loss via ODC degeneration. For this purpose a toxic model of demyelination has been developed that is based on the selective toxicity for ODCs of the copper chelator biscyclohexanone oxaldihydrazone (cuprizone) (Blakemore, 1972; Carlton, 1966) . If young mice are fed with cuprizone, focal demyelination occurs predominantly in the cerebellar cortex and peduncle. After withdrawal of the toxin spontaneous remyelination can be seen predominantly in the rostral regions (Skripuletz et al., 2010; Torkildsen et al., 2008) . Thereby the cuprizone-model correlates well with histopathological features of MS, especially in the subtype or variant classified as histological pattern III according to Lucchinetti et al. (2000) , which renders it a useful tool for MS research (Einstein et al., 2009; Kipp et al., 2009) . Paradoxically, according to a recent report of Herder et al. (2009) cuprizone ameliorates Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis suggesting that it might have immunomodulatory and/or anti-viral properties in addition to its toxic effects.\\n[ ( F i g . _ 2 ) T D $ F I G ] Fig. 2 . Putative auto-antigens in EAE with indication of their preferential localisation. Insets refer to the ODC membrane (inset 1), myelin surface zone (inset 2), compact myelin zone (inset 3), myelin/axon interface zone (inset 4), and nodal and paranodal zone of node of Ranvier (inset 5).

The resulting phenotype depends mainly on the antigen source and the genetic background of the animal species and strains used. For example, PLP 139-151 induces a relapsing-remitting EAE in SJL mice, whereas MOG 35-55 triggers chronic-progressive EAE in C57BL mice that are the most favored mice for transgenic experiments . Crossing of C57BL mice, which over-express MOG-TCR and MOGspecific B cells, resulted in a severe form of EAE that closely replicated Devic's variant of MS with inflammatory lesions of optic nerves and spinal cord (Bettelli et al., 2006) . MOG-TCR transgenic mice backcrossed to SJL/J background develop a relapsingremitting form of EAE with episodes altering between optic nerve, cerebellum and spinal cord. Evolution of this model depends on an intact B cell compartment. Apparently, MOG-TCR transgenic T cells expand endogenous auto-reactive B cells that manufacture pathogenic demyelinating auto-antibodies to a conformational epitope on native MOG protein whilst not recognizing the T cell target MOG peptide (Pö llinger et al., 2009 ). The authors claim to have generated the first spontaneous animal model for relapsingremitting MS. Current types of AT-EAE include those induced by Th17 cells suggesting that these newly detected effector cells may in part be responsible for the pathological heterogeneity of MS lesions (Afzali et al., 2007; Gold and Lü hder, 2008; Hofstetter et al., 2007 Hofstetter et al., , 2009 Jä ger et al., 2009; Korn et al., 2007; Quintana et al., 2008a; Reboldi et al., 2009) . All EAE models are directly accessible to investigation of the immune and nervous system (Fig. 3) , which interact during the pathogenesis of the disease and which are both targeted by established and experimental therapies.\\nSince MS appears to be a polygenetically determined disease, efforts have been undertaken by linkage and association studies to define chromosomal regions, quantitative trait loci (QTL), that control the susceptibility to the disease and to compare these QTL with the susceptibility loci in the animal model EAE (Serrano-Ferná ndez et al., 2004) . The high frequency of intergenomic EAE/MS consensus genes supports the value of EAE for studying of MS features. Backcross (offspring-parent mating) and intercross (sibling mating) experiments with EAE susceptible and resistant animal strains of mice, rats, guinea pigs and hamsters revealed mainly MHClinked QTL (Encinas et al., 1996; Olsson et al., 2000) . Combined-cross analysis could enhance the detection of QTL with moderate effects in rats (Jagodic and Olsson, 2006) . Genotyping of 150 microsatellite markers in F2 intercross populations of EAE-susceptible SJL/L mice and EAE-resistant C57BL/10.S mice identified QTL linked to increased latency of cortical motor evoked potentials in nonimmunized animals, which correlated with earlier onset of the disease (Mazó n Pelá ez et al., 2005) . This finding points to a role of myelin composition and synaptic transmission in susceptibility to EAE and provides a chance to detect individuals with high risk for autoimmune demyelination by QTL analysis before the disease is manifested. In MS, some immune response-related genes have been identified by genome-wide association studies using single nucleotide polymorphism analysis with microarray technique as being heritable risk factors of the disease, although their individual contribution is clearly modest with odds ratios for most not exceeding 1.2 (IMSGC, 2007) . These genes include the interleukin (IL)-2a and IL-7a receptor genes on chromosomes 10 and 5, respectively, and some human leukocyte antigens (HLA) belonging to MHC class II molecules on chromosome 6 (Table 2) IMSGC, 2007) . More recently, the genes encoding the following proteins have been confirmed as novel MS risk genes (explanation of abbreviations in Table 2 ) Dabbeekeh et al., 2007; De Jager et al., 2009a,b; Hafler et al., 2009; Hoppenbrouwers et al., 2008 Hoppenbrouwers et al., , 2009 IMSGC, 2007; Johnson et al., 2010; Mero et al., 2010; Rubio et al., 2008; Sarrias et al., 2007) : The strongest association to MS susceptibility, although not to the age of onset and severity of the disease, was found for the HLA-DRB1*1501 allel (Barcellos et al., 2006; Chao et al., 2008) , whereas transgenic mice over-expressing the human HLA-DRB1*1502 allel developed a severe MOG-EAE (Khare et al., 2005) . In contrast, genes related to antigen processing can also slow down disease progression as reflected by a milder course of the disease in MOG 35-55 -EAE of congenic NOR/LtJ mice compared to the wild-type NOD mice (Mayo and Quinn, 2007) . Similarly, congenic mapping of the rat genome confirmed that a chromosomal region homologous to a human MS susceptibility region confers protection against MOG-EAE (Jagodic et al., 2001) . Also, transgenic MOG 35-55 -EAE mice overexpressing the TCR for MOG 35-55 showed protective rather than pathogenic effects (Mendel et al., 2004) . In contrast, transgenic mice over-expressing MBP-specific TCR developed high frequency spontaneous EAE (Goverman et al., 1993; Lafaille et al., 1994) . The relevance of these findings for the human disease remains to be elucidated. Research in EAE also yielded hints for the existence of chromosomal loci that control disease susceptibility in dependence of age and season pointing to a role of chronobiology in autoimmunity (Teuscher et al., 2006) . Moreover, EAE susceptibility can vary even between different colonies of the same animal strain as demonstrated for Lewis rats purchased from different animal facilities (Gould et al., 1994) . Since the genetic background of these animals is almost identical, other mechanisms, preferentially those involving gene regulating, may be responsible for differences in disease susceptibility and progression. Transcriptome and proteome analyses are powerful new tools for the elucidation of those mechanisms Fernald et al., 2005; Goertsches and Zettl, 2007; Ibrahim et al., 2001; Ibrahim and Gold, 2005) .\\nAn integrated analysis of available data from genome-wide genetic screens and high-throughput gene expression studies in MS and EAE revealed that differentially expressed genes appear mainly in clusters rather than in uniform distribution throughout the genome (Fernald et al., 2005) . The hereby included hypothesisneutral gene expression studies are mainly performed with microarray technique (RNA profiling) and applied in MS patients to peripheral blood mononuclear cells or brain tissue and in EAE animals to lymphatic and nervous tissue Tajouri et al., 2007) . They deliver an increasing wealth of data, which implies a great challenge for bioinformatic analysis that may include pathway analyses using background information from the Gene Ontology project and other data bases as well as data mining approaches. Results of gene expression studies are generally hampered by methodical problems such as the heterogeneity of the material from different individuals and the difficulties in defining a reasonable threshold for differentially expressed genes. Nevertheless, meaningful data have already been obtained from expression studies in EAE that point to new EAE-QTL and susceptibility genes, dissect new pathogenic and protective pathways and identify new therapeutic targets (Comabella and Martin, 2007; Jelinsky et al., 2005; Matejuk et al., 2003; Mazó n Pelá ez et al., 2005; Mix et al., 2002 Mix et al., , 2006 Paintlia et al., 2004) . As an example, the comparison of the EAE-resistant strain C57BL/10.S with the EAE-susceptible strain C57BL/6 in the MOG 35-55 -EAE model strongly supported EAE-resistance to be an active process revealing new target genes for therapeutic intervention (Mix et al., 2004) . Moreover, data of Baranzini et al. (2005) derived from the MOG 35-55 -EAE model led to new conclusions such as (i) early non-specific BBB impairment (mainly neutrophil-related) secondary to immunization with CFA, (ii) transition from innate to adaptive immune responses before onset of EAE, (iii) identification of at least 3 discrete EAE phases (early EAE, peak EAE and early recovery) with characteristic gene expression patterns, and (iv) early neuronal damage.\\nTherefore, gene expression studies can provide new insights into the dynamics of discrete early and progressive phases of EAE on the transcriptional level, which are consistent with the histological and clinical phenotype. They can serve as a tool for fingerprinting of individual disease processes in man. As a practical consequence new therapeutic targets surface. RNA profiling has also enabled researchers to identify genes which support maintenance of the hematopoietic stem cell niche synapse as a source for therapeutic mesenchymal stem cells that can ameliorate EAE (Pedemonte et al., 2007) . On the other hand, EAE can also serve as a tool to validate new targets derived from gene-microarray analysis (Lock et al., 2002) .\\nDespite the clear benefit of the transcriptome approach there are voices advising caution concerning overinterpretation of results of global gene expression analysis. In any case, due to its obvious limitations transcriptomics should be employed only with a clear and specific question in mind and carefully in view of the regulatory settings and potential pitfalls of the technique (Casciano and Woodcock, 2006; Fathallah-Shaykh, 2005) . The same is true for the proteome approach (reviewed in Elkabes and Li, 2007; Linker et al., 2009a) . In EAE, it has served to generate differential protein Table 2 Susceptibility genes of MS.\\nFunction References HLA-DRB1*1501 Antigen presentation Barcellos et al. (2006) , Chao et al.

Also putative lipid auto-antigens could be identified by the microarray approach in MS and EAE (Kanter et al., 2006; Quintana et al., 2008b) .\\nThere is still consensus amongst most researchers that immunological processes play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of MS Linker et al., 2008c; Steinman and Zamvil, 2006; Weiner, 2009) , although the aetiological factors may vary between different subtypes of MS and may not primarily affect the immune system, especially in cases with the histopathologic patterns III and IV according to Lucchinetti et al. (2000) . Moreover, in early MS with histologic patterns I-III Wallerian degeneration seems to contribute significantly to axonal loss in the plaques and periplaque white matter (Dziedzic et al., 2010) . The current concept of pathogenetic processes in MS is schematically depicted in Fig. 4 , which indicates also therapeutic interventions and their putative targets. Recent paradigm shifts relate to the recognition of new roles for CD8 + T cells (Friese and Fugger, 2009 ), B cells (Franciotta et al., 2008) , innate immunity (Weiner, 2009 ) and emerging pathogenic pathways causing neuronal damage Centonze et al., 2010; Dziedzic et al., 2010; Herz et al., 2009) .\\nEAE models have considerably contributed to our understanding of immune regulatory processes in the pathogenesis of MS Wekerle et al., 1994) . While traditionally regulatory (suppressive) activity in autoimmune processes was primarily attributed to CD8 + T cells , more recently CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + regulatory T cells (Yi et al., 2006) have attracted interest in this respect (Ephrem et al., 2008; Paintlia et al., 2008; Tischner et al., 2006) . They seem to be important as antagonists of CD4 + Th17 cells (Afzali et al., 2007; Littman and Rudensky, 2010; Quintana et al., 2008a) that are supposed to be effector cells in EAE (Hofstetter et al., 2007; Huppert et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010; Steinman, 2007) and MS (Gold and Lü hder, 2008) . However, the pathogenic role of Th17 cells and of IL-17 in EAE is controversial. According to findings of Haak et al. (2009) in transgenic mice the in vivo function of IL-17 in the CNS may be redundant and the members of the IL-17 family IL-17A and IL-17F may contribute only marginally to the autoimmune pathogenesis of MOG 35-55 -EAE. On the other hand, Huppert et al. (2010) found that IL-17A promotes breakdown of the BBB, a crucial step in the development of EAE. Moreover, findings of Nowak et al. (2009) point to a pro-inflammatory role of the Th17-derived IL-9 in MOG 35-55 -EAE. Th17 cells are driven by IL-21 (Korn et al., 2007) and IL-23 (Langrish et al., 2005; McKenzie et al., 2006) and suppressed by IL-27 (Fitzgerald et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008) . Recently, the IL-7-IL-7R pathway has been implicated in the survival and expansion of effector/memory Th17 cells. Blockade of IL-7R rendered differentiated Th17 cells susceptible to apoptosis which led to attenuation of MOG-EAE . Corresponding IL-17 + CD8 + Tc cells show impaired cytotoxicity and IFN-g production, but may through their excessive IL-17 production contribute to inflammatory processes in EAE and MS (Huber et al., 2009) . Recently, Sobottka et al. (2009) could demonstrate in brain slices of transgenic mice that myelindirected CD8 + Tc cells cause extensive damage not only of the myelin sheath, but also of the axons. Consequently, these cells may contribute to axonal loss in EAE and probably also in MS with the immunopathologic pattern I according to Lucchinetti et al. (2000) .\\nB cells are involved in the immunopathogenesis of MS and EAE at least by two functional activities, i.e. as antigen-presenting cells [ ( F i g . _ 4 ) T D $ F I G ] Fig. 4 . Putative pathogenic mechanisms of MS. Auto-reactive lymphocytes may be recruited from peripheral lymphoid organs and after migration through the BBB reactivated in the CNS, where an inflammatory cascade is initiated leading to subsequent damage of myelin and axons. Alternatively, primary oligodendroglial and axonal degeneration may be followed by an inflammatory autoimmune process. The adjacent table depicts the putative pathogenic processes that are targeted by established and experimental therapies. Treatments are grouped according to the contribution made by EAE to their development, i.e. they are either successfully translated into the clinic (green), only successful in EAE (red) or currently tested in EAE and/or MS (yellow).

In addition they may co-stimulate T cells, facilitate recruitment of inflammatory cells to the CNS and myelin opsonization, but also promote remyelination, and take part in immunoregulatory processes. Antimyelin antibodies are supposed to be major components of the histopathologic MS pattern II according to Lucchinetti et al. (2000) . A special role as targets for antibodies in distinct types of EAE and MS is ascribed to the myelin molecules MOG (Haase et al., 2001) and the axonal molecule neurofascin (Hohlfeld et al., 2008) .\\nAnother distinct lymphocyte subpopulation that has been implicated in CNS autoimmunity is the gd + T cell subset bearing\\nTCRgd. These fetal-type T cells are increased in number in MS cerebrospinal fluid (Mix et al., 1990) and may exert pathogenic and regulatory functions (reviewed in Blink and Goverman, 2009 ). Interestingly, the majority of IL-17 producing host cells in a Th1-mediated AT-EAE belonged to the gd + T cell type (Lees et al., 2008) .\\nAdding to the complexity, there is an obvious pathogenic role for EAE and MS of innate immunity mediated by dendritic cells, monocytes and microglia (Furtado et al., 2006) . Whereas the adaptive immune system seems to drive mainly relapses of MS, abnormalities of the innate immune system may prevail in the progressive stage of the disease (Weiner, 2009 ).\\nAn important aspect of MS pathogenesis is the apoptotic activity in the lymphatic and nervous system. Therefore, apoptotic processes have been analysed in EAE. While apoptosis plays obviously a pivotal pathogenic role when affecting ODCs (Hö velmeyer et al., 2005) , it appears to be protective when eliminating myelin-reactive and bystander T cells (Zettl et al., 1997) . This process is augmented by therapeutic drugs such as methylprednisolone (MP) (Schmidt et al., 2000) and resveratrol (Singh et al., 2007) .\\nThe role of cytokines and neurotrophic factors for the pathogenesis of MS and EAE has been investigated in a plethora of studies and the results have been reviewed elsewhere (Goverman, 2009; Imitola et al., 2005; Link, 1998; Linker et al., 2009b; Mirowska-Guzel, 2009; Owens et al., 2001; Ozenci et al., 2002) . For details the reader is referred to these reviews.\\nIn addition to the mentioned immunopathogenic pathways a direct crosstalk between the immune and nervous system may influence the pathogenesis of MS and EAE (Kerschensteiner et al., 2009; Mix et al., 2007) . This involves direct effects of cytokines and chemokines on nerve cells and modulation of immune cell activity by neurotrophins and neurotransmitters implicating new treatment approaches, e.g. by associative conditioning . Disclosure of the complex mechanisms of neuro-immune interactions requires further investigations in the EAE model.\\nMany other aspects of MS research are investigated in the animal model. Among them monitoring of disease activity by traditional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Morrissey et al., 1996) and new bioluminescence techniques (Luo et al., 2008) deserve special attention. Identification of reliable surrogate markers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes (responder detection for specific therapies, disease follow-up) will be a prominent task of the future. However, a consistent limitation for the translation of experimental results into the clinic is the different situation in EAE and MS concerning the timeline of detection of clinical signs and of therapeutic interventions (Fig. 5) . Whereas in EAE pathological processes can be observed from the beginning and treatment approaches can be started at the early pre-clinical phase, in MS diagnostic measures will commonly not be initiated before first clinical signs are present and the intensity of treatment increases usually until late progression of the disease.\\nDespite extensive screening for new targets of MS therapy in EAE so far only a few of the established MS therapies have been developed in the animal model. Examples are glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone and natalizumab (Kieseier and Hartung, 2003; Steinman and Zamvil, 2006) .\\nThe glatiramer acetate preparation is a random polymer consisting of repeated sequences of the four amino acids glutamic acid, lysine, alanine and tyrosine that occur in MBP in a specific molar ratio. It was primarily called copolymer 1 and tested first for its encephalitogenic potency and subsequently for its influence on guinea pig EAE (Teitelbaum et al., 1971) . Surprisingly, it turned out that copolymer 1 suppressed rather than induced EAE, most probably via stimulation of Th2/Th3-mediated anti-MBP immune response (Aharoni et al., 1997 (Aharoni et al., , 2008 . Recent studies utilising sophisticated immunologic techniques point to a more complex mechanism of action of glatiramer acetate, including modification and killing of APCs, generation of regulatory T cells and turning the polyclonal CD8 + T cell response into an oligoclonal one .\\nMitoxantrone has first been proven to be a powerful immunosuppressive drug in EAE (Ridge et al., 1985) and it is now a second-line component of escalating MS therapy (Hartung et al., 2002; Krapf et al., 2005; Neuhaus et al., 2006a,b; Rieckmann et al., 2004) . Its mechanism of action relies most probably on cytotoxic effects on lymphocytes and induction of apoptosis of APC such as monocytes and dendritic cells (Neuhaus et al., 2005; Vollmer et al., 2010) .\\nNatalizumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that inhibits the transmigration of immune cells into the inflamed parenchyma of lymphatic organs and the CNS. It binds to a4b1-integrin (CD49dCD29, very late activation antigen-4) on lymphocytes and blocks the interaction with the integrin ligand CD106 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) on endothelia cells thereby being effective in preventing EAE (Rice et al., 2005; Yednock et al., 1992) . It is the first mAb approved for therapeutic trials in MS (Polman et al., 2006) now belonging to second-line MS therapeutics, although it carries the risk to activate the polyoma virus JC leading to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, especially if applied in combination with IFN-b (Clifford et al., 2010; Kleinschmidt-DeMasters and Tyler, 2005; Langer-Gould et al., 2005; Stü ve and Bennett, 2007; Yousry et al., 2006) . Recently, even cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy on natalizumab monotherapy have been reported (Clifford et al., 2010; Hartung, 2009; Hartung et al., 2009; Lindå et al., 2009; Wenning et al., 2009) .\\nA number of established MS therapies have subsequently been investigated in the EAE model. The aims are:\\n(i) to get a deeper insight into the mechanisms of action including disclosure of the specific targets of the therapies and (ii) to improve regimens of old therapies and to develop new therapies targeting the same pathogenic mechanisms, but being more convenient for clinical practice (low frequency of application, oral application) and avoiding adverse side-effects.\\nFor example, with respect to methylprednisolone therapy for MS relapses Schmidt et al. (2000) could unravel a switch from cytoplasmic to nuclear effects accompanied by enhanced T cell apoptosis with increasing steroid dosage. Moreover, liposome encapsulated MP revealed a dose-dependently increased therapeutic efficiency compared to free MP in EAE (Linker et al., 2008b) . In IFN-b treated EAE, interruption of therapy caused disease exacerbation (van der Meide et al., 1998) . In an attempt to explore the influence of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy on the local immune response in the CNS, Jørgensen et al. (2007) found accumulation of IVIg only in active CNS lesions with BBB breakdown limiting its prospects for repair processes. However, natural CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + regulatory T cells were enhanced by prophylactic application of IVIg in an EAE study of Ephrem et al. (2008) suggesting a potential benefit of this therapy in early onset MS.\\nIn other therapeutic trials, two treatments have been combined in order to achieve synergistic effects and/or to reduce adverse side-effects of single agents. For example, combined application of MP and erythropoietin protected neurons and axons of retinal ganglion cells and optic nerve of rats with MOG-induced EAE from morphological and functional impairment, whereas monotherapy caused only isolated neuronal or axonal protection without clinical benefit (Diem et al., 2005) . In a MBP-induced active rat EAE model, the anti-inflammatory, anti-demyelinating and neuroprotective effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitory statins could be improved by combination with the selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor rolipram (Paintlia et al., 2008; Paintlia et al., 2009) or the protein kinase A activating substance 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-b-D-ribofuranoside (Paintlia et al., 2006) , even when the statin was applied in suboptimal doses. For rolipram alone, beneficial effects in the animal model could previously not be reproduced in the human system (Zhu et al., 2001) . In actively induced chronic murine EAE a synergistic therapeutic effect of IFN-b and the immunomodulatory drug laquinimod was observed (Runströ m et al., 2006) . In a patient study, the IFN-b-mediated up-regulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was enhanced by additive administration of the non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxiphylline (Weber et al., 1998) . Pentoxiphylline also reduced side-effects of IFN-b therapy such as myalgia, fever and injection site reactions (Rieckmann et al., 1996) . IVIg decreased T cell apoptosis and liver damage, but increased ODC apoptosis in high-dose MBP-treated rats with AT-EAE induced by MBP-specific T cells (Weishaupt et al., 2002) . But there are also perilous combination effects, which cannot always be foreseen and thereby prevented in the animal model as illustrated by the hazardous combination of IFN-b with natalizumab Kleinschmidt-DeMasters and Tyler, 2005; Langer-Gould et al., 2005; Stü ve and Bennett, 2007) or statin (Birnbaum et al., 2008) .\\nWhile disease-modifying agents act largely through modulation of peripheral immune mechanisms, some of them appear to act additionally or even predominantly locally within the CNS, e.g. at the BBB like IFN-b (Dhib-Jalbut and Marks, 2010) and natalizumab (Rice et al., 2005) , on resident auto-reactive T cells and ODC like fingolimod (Miron et al., 2008 (Miron et al., , 2010 Papadopoulos et al., 2010) . When entering the CNS via a locally disrupted BBB at lesion site, IFN-b may also directly act on astrocytes (Boutros et al., 1997) and microglia (Prinz et al., 2008) and even exert direct protective effects on neurons (Plioplys and Massimini, 1995) .\\nOn the other hand, there are several examples of compounds which were quite effective in curtailing disease activity in the animal model but turned out to lack therapeutic utility or proved to generate inacceptable adverse effect in MS patients. These inconsistencies prompted Sriram and Steiner (2005) to consider EAE a ''misleading model of MS''. Examples for therapy failures in MS are given in Table 3 . Reasons for the discrepant result obtained in the animal and human systems could be manifold. Their nature may be genetic (species differences, peculiarities of inbred animal strains), pathogenetic (individual variability between MS patients) or kinetic (different ontogeny and biorhythms, temporal differences of immune reactivity and response to therapy). Additionally, in MS the BBB may be insufficiently disrupted as compared to EAE thereby preventing therapeutic molecules to reach their target within the CNS. This seems to be relevant especially when targeting cytokines in MS. For example, the mAb to IL-12 p40 ustekinumab failed to improve relapsing-remitting MS despite promising results in rodent and marmoset EAE (Segal et al., 2008; reviewed in Steinman, 2010) . Other promising therapeutic principles revealed already in the animal model limited benefit or adverse effects precluding their use as MS therapeutics. Examples are:\\n(i) the neuroprotective polypeptide hormone ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), which elicited an acute-phase response in rat liver (Dittrich et al., 1994) , (ii) the anti-adhesion molecule mAb anti-CD54, which revealed no MRI effect in AT-EAE (Morrissey et al., 1996) , (iii) the Na + -channel blocker phenytoin, which potentially protects demyelinated axons, but resulted in exacerbation of MOG-EAE after withdrawal (Black et al., 2007) , (iv) the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor rolipram, while very effective in suppressing EAE, failed to suppress inflammatory activity as gleaned through magnetic resonance imaging in a pilot trial in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (Bielekova et al., 2009 ), (v) the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A prevented BBB disruption and suppressed the development of EAE, but was classified as unacceptable for treatment of MS based on risk/benefit consideration due to low efficacy and frequent adverse reactions (Goodin et al., 2002; Kappos et al., 1988; Kieseier and Hartung, 2003; McCombe et al., 1999; Paul and Bolton, 1995) .\\nIf one therefore considers only the therapeutic trials conducted in EAE and their translation into the clinic, it may well be regarded as a misleading model of MS. However, several aspects of the aetiopathogenesis of MS such as susceptibility genes, immunoregulatory circuits, mechanisms of immune cell activation, migration and elimination as well as of nervous tissue destruction and repair have been successfully studied in EAE rendering it a useful model of MS (Hemmer and Hartung, 2007; Schreiner et al., 2009 ). EAE will be of continued utility in the future if one capitalizes on the availability of distinct types of EAE, including those induced in transgenic and knockout animals, to explore pathogenic pathways and strategies of intervention in different subtypes or variants of MS.\\nAs outlined before, several therapeutic interventions have been successful exclusively in EAE, but not in MS. Other therapeutic agents have shown proven benefit in both EAE and MS. A survey of these agents is given in Table 4 . There are also few instances where therapeutic agents for the treatment of MS have been clinically developed without prior evaluation in the animal model. Examples of such drugs including their proposed mechanism of action are listed in Table 5 .\\nNonetheless, an increasing number of emerging therapies for MS are currently being tested in pre-clinical phases by making use of the EAE model (Cohen and Rieckmann, 2007; Linker et al., 2008c; Weiner, 2009) . The most promising experimental therapies rely on gene transfer, stem cell transplantation, oral administration of small molecular weight disease-modifying drugs and intravenous or subcutaneous application of mAb targeting cells or molecules crucial in the pathogenesis of the disease Bielekova and Becker, 2010; Butti et al., 2008; Einstein et al., 2009; Hauser et al., 2008; Hawker et al., 2009; Hemmer and Hartung, 2007; Kieseier and Wiendl, 2007; Pluchino and Martino, 2008; Wynn et al., 2010) . Table 6 provides a survey of experimental therapeutic approaches that are currently being investigated, some of which being already approved for phase I-III clinical trials. Table 6 also includes proposed mechanisms of action of the new therapies. Putative targets of established and experimental MS therapies with and without prior testing in EAE are indicated in Fig. 4 . Other experimental approaches for MS are based on vaccination, e.g. with pathogenic T cells, TCRs, dendritic cells pulsed with antigen, DNA vaccine encoding MBP, axonal growth inhibitors associated with myelin or pro-inflammatory cytokines. These approaches are extensively reviewed elsewhere (Correale et al., 2008) . Recently, a new therapeutic target for a more selective treatment of EAE and MS compared to available therapies has been proposed, i.e. the IL-7-IL-7R pathway that affects pathogenic Th17 cells, but spares regulatory T cells and unrelated immune cells .\\nAn important field of therapeutic approaches in EAE and MS that will deserve more attention in the future is the enhancement of remyelination. So far experimental trials have involved transplantation of neural stem cells, ODC precursor cells, Schwann cells and olfactory ensheathing cells and application of growth factors such as platelet derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor (Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2008) . However, these trials are hampered by the fact that the demyelinating Table 4 Therapeutic agents effective in both MS and EAE.\\nClinically isolated syndrome (CIS) MS EAE Azathioprine Yudkin et al.

Aktas et al. (2004) lesions are regularly wide-spread and dispersed within the CNS and that they, additionally, lack stimulating factors of ODC precursor cell recruitment and differentiation, or even contain inhibitory factors of remyelination like the neurite outgrowth inhibitor-A (Nogo-A) and its receptor component leucin-rich repeat and Ig domain containing-1 (Lingo-1) (Pernet et al., 2008) . Therefore, current efforts to enhance remyelination in EAE and MS rely mainly on established therapies with remyelinating potency such as IVIg, especially polyclonal IgM (Bieber et al., 2000; Trebst and Stangel, 2006; Wright et al., 2009) , glatiramer acetate (Aharoni et al., 2008; Arnon and Aharoni, 2009; Racke et al., 2010) and fingolimod (Miron et al., 2008 (Miron et al., , 2010 or on the application of antagonists of the remyelination inhibitors Nogo-A and Lingo-1 (Bourquin et al., 2008; Mi et al., 2007 Mi et al., , 2009 Rudick et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2010) . This review is restricted to the EAE model of MS and a short reference to the toxic cuprizone-mediated model of demyelin-ation. Further information on advantages and disadvantages of EAE and additionally of virus-mediated demyelinating diseases can be derived from the excellent monograph ''Experimental models of multiple sclerosis'' edited by Lavi and Constantinescu (2005) .\\nIn summary, specific questions of MS genetics, pathogenesis and therapy require investigations in different available and forthcoming EAE models. A comparison of the most important immunopathological, clinical and therapeutic features of EAE and MS is given in Table 7 . Thereby it becomes obvious that great precaution is advisable when translating the results of experimental therapeutic trials into clinical practice.\\nEilhard Mix, Hans Meyer-Rienecker, Hans-Peter Hartung and Uwe K.

       " 'We\\nreport copper-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenative carboxylation\\n(ODC) of unactivated alkanes with various substituted benzoic acids\\nto produce the corresponding allylic esters. Spectroscopic studies\\n(EPR, UV–vis) revealed that the resting state of the catalyst\\nis [(BPI)Cu(O2CPh)] (1-O2CPh), formed from [(BPI)Cu(PPh3)2], oxidant, and benzoic acid. Catalytic and stoichiometric\\nreactions of 1-O2CPh with alkyl radicals and radical probes imply that C–H bond\\ncleavage occurs by a tert-butoxy radical. In addition,\\nthe deuterium kinetic isotope effect from reactions of cyclohexane\\nand d12-cyclohexane in separate\\nvessels showed that the turnover-limiting step for the ODC of cyclohexane\\nis C–H bond cleavage. To understand the origin of the difference\\nin products formed from copper-catalyzed amidation and copper-catalyzed\\nODC, reactions of an alkyl radical with a series of copper–carboxylate,\\ncopper–amidate, and copper–imidate complexes were performed.\\nThe results of competition experiments revealed that the relative\\nrate of reaction of alkyl radicals with the copper complexes follows\\nthe trend Cu(II)–amidate > Cu(II)–imidate > Cu(II)–benzoate.\\nConsistent with this trend, Cu(II)–amidates and Cu(II)–benzoates\\ncontaining more electron-rich aryl groups on the benzamidate and benzoate\\nreact faster with the alkyl radical than do those with more electron-poor\\naryl groups on these ligands to produce the corresponding products.\\nThese data on the ODC of cyclohexane led to preliminary investigation\\nof copper-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenative amination of cyclohexane\\nto generate a mixture of N-alkyl and N-allylic products.\\nHerein, we report the copper-catalyzed\\noxidative dehydrogenative\\ncarboxylation (ODC) of unactivated alkanes in the presence of\\ncarboxylic acid derivatives to form the corresponding allylic ester\\n(Scheme 1). This reaction is related to the\\nclassic Kharasch–Sosnovsky reaction,24 but the starting material is an alkane, rather than an alkene. The\\nreactions occur by oxidative dehydrogenation of an alkane and\\noxidation of the resulting allylic C–H bond. Detailed\\nmechanistic studies show that the tert-butoxy radical\\nabstracts a C–H bond of cyclohexane to generate a transient\\ncyclohexyl radical, and this radical is converted to cyclohexene\\nby a copper–benzoate complex. The cyclohexene is then\\noxidized to form the allylic ester product. The relative rates for\\ntrapping of the radical by the ligand on copper versus conversion\\nof the radical to an alkene control the selectivity for the formation\\nof allylic vs alkyl ester products.\\nDevelopment of Intermolecular ODC of Cyclohexane\\nInitial Studies of ODC of Cyclohexane\\nReaction Development of Catalytic\\nODC of Cyclohexanea\\nThe scope of the ODC of cyclohexane\\nwith carboxylic acids to form allylic esters is presented in Table 2. The yields of these reactions are based on carboxylic\\nacid. The mass balance consisted of unreacted carboxylic acid and\\nmethyl benzoate, the origin of which will be discussed later in the\\npaper. The reaction is tolerant of halogens on the benzoic acid 4-X-C6H4-CO2H (X = F (1a), Cl\\n(2a), Br (3a)), forming the corresponding\\nallylic esters in 57–79% yields in these cases. The reaction\\nis also tolerant of a halide (1c, 2c), methoxy\\n(4c), and acetyl group (5c) in the ortho position. Carboxylic acids containing electron-donating\\nsubstituents on the aromatic system, such as methyl (1b,d,e), tert-butyl (2b), methoxy (1f), 4-phenoxy (2f), and phthalimido (l) groups, generated the corresponding\\nallylic ester products in 56–71% yields. Substrates containing\\nelectron-withdrawing substituents, such as acetyl (m),\\ntrifluoromethyl (j), cyano (p), and carboalkoxy\\n(n) groups, also gave the corresponding products in moderate\\nto good yields (52–76%). Even a thioether (h)\\nis tolerated, despite the oxidizing conditions of the catalytic reaction;\\ncyclohex-2-en-1-yl 4-(methylthio)benzoate was produced in 69%\\nyield.\\nIntermolecular ODC Cyclic and Acyclic\\nAlkanes to Allylic Estersa\\nFinally, vinyl and aliphatic\\ncarboxylic acids reacted to form allylic\\nesters. Specifically, the ODC of cyclohexane with cyclohexanecarboxylic\\nacid (s), (E)-2-methyl-3-phenylacrylic\\nacid (t), octanoic acid (1u), and phenylacetic\\nacid (2u) gave cyclohex-2-en-1-yl cyclohexanecarboxylate\\n(62%), cyclohex-2-en-1-yl (E)-2-methyl-3-phenylacrylate\\n(57%), cyclohex-2-en-1-yl octanoate (69%), and cyclohex-2-en-1-yl\\n2-phenylacetate (69%), respectively.\\nThe reaction also\\noccurred with smaller or larger cycloalkanes\\nand, to an extent, with acyclic alkanes. Reactions of benzoic acids\\nwith cyclopentane and cycloheptane in the presence of 5 mol% of CuCl\\nyielded the corresponding products in good yield (cyclopent-2-en-yl\\nbenzoate (1v, 75%), cyclohept-2-en-yl benzoate (2v 75%)), but the reaction with cyclooctane formed cyclooct-2-en-yl\\nbenzoate (3v, 12%) in modest yield. In addition to reactions\\nof cyclic alkanes, reactions of linear alkanes (i.e., pentane) containing\\nmultiple C–H bonds were performed to assess the selectivity\\nof the catalytic ODC. The reaction of pentane and benzoic acid in\\nthe presence of 2.5 mol% of 1-PPh3 and tBuOOtBu produced two products:\\npent-en-2-yl benzoate34 (1w, 26%) and pent-1-en-3-yl benzoate35 (2w, 10%). The potential product of pen-2-en-1-yl benzoate,\\nwhich would be obtained from the oxidation of the pent-2-ene\\nintermediate at the primary C–H bond, was not observed. This\\nobservation suggests that oxidation of a secondary allylic C–H\\nbond is favored over oxidation of a primary allylic C–H\\nbond. This relative reactivity is consistent with the relative C–H\\nbond dissociation energies.36 The reaction\\nof 2,2-dimethylpentane and benzoic acid produced 4,4-dimethylpent-1-en-3-yl\\nbenzoate37 (y, 16%) and methyl\\nbenzoate (80%) as the major byproduct.\\nTo assess the sequence of bond-forming events in the catalytic\\nODC of cyclohexane, we conducted the reaction of cyclohexyl\\nbenzoate and cyclohexene (separately) (Scheme 6,A) with tBuOOtBu and the\\ncopper catalyst. These two reactions reveal whether formation\\nof the alkene occurs before or after formation of the C–O\\nbond. The reaction of cyclohexyl benzoate, benzoic acid, and tBuOOtBu with 2.5 mol% of 1-O2CPh at 100 °C for 24 h\\ndid not form cyclohex-2-en-1-yl benzoate. Instead, this reaction\\ngenerated methyl benzoate (16%). The detection of methyl benzoate\\nindicates that tert-butoxy radical was generated\\nfrom the reaction of tBuOOtBu with\\ncopper, but that this radical reacts more slowly with the cyclohexyl\\nbenzoate than it undergoes β-methyl scission to generate the\\nmethyl radical (which reacts with the copper–benzoate complex\\nto form methyl benzoate).31\\nIn contrast to the\\nreaction of cyclohexyl benzoate, the reaction\\nof cyclohexene with benzoic acid and tBuOOtBu in the presence of 2.5 mol% 1-O2CPh generated the allylic ester. This\\nreaction formed cyclohex-2-en-1-yl benzoate in 58% yield and\\nmethyl benzoate in 27% yield after 24 h at 100 °C (Scheme 6B). Moreover, the reaction of cyclohexane\\nwith tBuOOtBu in the presence of\\n1 mol% of 1-O2CPh (based on tBuOOtBu) in benzene-d6 at 100 °C for 20 h (Scheme 6C) formed cyclohexene in 12% yield, with respect to\\ncyclohexane, as determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy.\\nThese results clearly indicate that ODC of cyclohexane to cyclohex-2-en-1-yl\\nbenzoate proceeds by initial conversion of the cycloalkane to the\\ncycloalkene, followed by oxidation of the cycloalkene to the\\nfinal allylic ester product.\\nThe stoichiometric and\\ncatalytic ODC of benzoic acid with cyclohexane\\nforms methyl benzoate as the major side product. The observation of\\nthis product is consistent with the intermediacy of tert-butoxy radical. β-Methyl scission of a tert-butoxy radical is known to produce a methyl radical, and this radical\\nwould react with the resting-state 1-O2CPh to give methyl benzoate.\\nParallel reactions were performed with cyclohexane and cyclohexane-d12 to determine if cleavage of the C–H\\nbond of the alkane is the turnover-limiting step of the copper-catalyzed\\nODC of cyclohexane. A comparison of the initial rates for catalytic\\nODC of octanoic acid with cyclohexane and cyclohexane-d12 in separate vessels revealed a KIE value\\nof 2.8 ± 0.2 (Scheme 10). This observed\\nKIE value indicates that C–H bond cleavage is the turnover-limiting\\nstep.\\nIntermolecular ODC of Cyclohexane and Cyclohexane-d12\\nIn addition, a comparison\\nof the rates of the catalytic reaction\\nof octanoic acid with cyclohexane and cyclohexene revealed\\nthat the conversion of cyclohexene to cyclohex-2-en-1-yl\\noctanoate is faster than the conversion of cyclohexane.30 After 1 h, the reaction of octanoic acid and\\ncyclohexene cleanly produced 40% of cyclohex-2-en-1-yl\\noctanoate, whereas the reaction of octanoic acid with cyclohexane\\nproduced only 4% of cyclohex-2-en-1-yl octanoate and 2% of methyl\\noctanoate. This result clearly indicates that abstraction of the C–H\\nbond from cyclohexane, not from cyclohexene, is the turnover-limiting\\nstep in the catalytic ODC.\\nThe roles of copper in the catalytic ODC of cyclohexane are\\nclosely related to those of copper in the catalytic amidation\\nof cyclohexane we reported recently.28 However, the two reactions form products containing different hydrocarbyl\\ngroups (alkyl vs allylic), and the difference between these groups\\nlikely stems from a difference in relative rates for reaction of the\\nalkyl radical with the copper–benzoate and copper–amidate\\ncomplexes. The alkyl radical can undergo electron transfer, or it\\ncan combine with a ligand at copper to form a product containing a\\nnew carbon–heteroatom bond (Scheme 11). Apparently, oxidation of the alkyl radical by the\\ncopper–benzoate is faster than reaction of the alkyl radical\\nwith the benzoate ligand, whereas oxidation of the alkyl radical\\nby the copper–amidate is slower than reaction of the alkyl\\nradical with the amidate ligand (Scheme 11).\\nThird, a competition reaction was performed with 1-O2Chept and 1-NHC(O)hept in the presence of cyclohexane and tBuOOtBu at 100 °C in benzene (Scheme 13). Unlike a methyl radical, a cyclohexyl radical can\\nform a carbon–heteroatom bond or convert to cyclohexene;\\ncarboxylation of the resulting alkene then forms an allylic\\nester. The reaction of the two copper complexes formed N-cyclohexyloctanamide in 92% yield and the allylic\\nester product cyclohex-2-en-1-yl benzoate in 30% yield. This\\nresult is consistent with faster reaction of an alkyl radical with\\na copper–amidate than with a copper–benzoate, but the\\norigin of the absence of product from reaction of the allylic radical\\nwith the copper–amidate is unclear. We also observed the ODC\\nof cyclohexane to cyclohex-2-en-1-yl benzoate only after\\nan appreciable amount of 1-NHC(O)hept is consumed because 1-NHC(O)hept would react rapidly with the transient alkyl\\nradical.\\nEffect of Aromatic\\nSubstituents on Copper–Benzoate Complexes\\non ODC of Cyclohexane\\nThe step that distinguishes\\nthe reactivity of copper-catalyzed ODC of cyclohexane and copper-catalyzed\\namidation of cyclohexane is the reaction of the transient\\ncyclohexyl radical with a copper–benzoate\\nversus a copper–amidate or copper–imidate\\nintermediate. Specifically, alkyl radicals react faster with copper–amidate\\nand imidate complexes than they do with copper–benzoates.\\nMoreover, more electron-rich copper–amidate and benzoate\\ncomplexes react faster with alkyl radicals than more electron-deficient\\ncopper–amidate and benzoate complexes. Lastly, the\\nslower rate of reactions of alkyl radicals with copper–benzoate\\nallows electron transfer to occur faster than ligand transfer, unless\\nthe alkyl radical is not able to form an alkene (i.e., a methyl radical).\\nWhen the alkyl radical cannot form an alkene, ligand transfer occurs\\nto form an O-alkyl product. Based on these hypotheses,\\nwe investigated copper-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenative amination\\n(ODA) of cyclohexane with electron-deficient amides. More electron-deficient\\ncopper–amidate and imidate complexes would undergo slower reactions\\nwith an alkyl radical and faster electron transfer.\\nProposed\\nMechanism for ODC of Cyclohexane\\nA proposed mechanism for\\nthe catalytic ODC of cyclohexane\\nto cyclohex-2-en-1-yl benzoate is presented in Scheme 20. In this pathway, catalysis is initiated by the\\ndecomposition of tBuOOtBu by 1-PPh3 to produce a tert-butoxy radical and [(BPI)CuOtBu], which rapidly\\nreacts with benzoic acid to form 1-O2CPh and tBuOH. The tert-butoxy radical can undergo reversible, secondary internal return\\nto regenerate tBuOOtBu or abstract\\na hydrogen atom from cyclohexane to generate a cyclohexyl\\nradical. To form the unsaturated product, 1-O2CPh would oxidize the alkyl radical by\\none electron to form a carbocation, and the carbocation\\nwould undergo deprotonation by an anionic Cu(I) species [(BPI)Cu(O2CPh)]− to give cyclohexene and benzoic\\nacid. The resulting cyclohexene would then undergo a second\\nC–H abstraction by a tert-butoxy radical to\\ngive an allylic radical that reacts with 1-O2CPh to release the allylic ester product\\nand regenerate a (BPI)Cu(I) species to complete the catalytic cycle.\\nIn a side reaction, the tert-butoxy radical would\\ndecompose to a methyl radical and acetone. The methyl radical would\\nthen combine with 1-O2CPh to produce methyl benzoate and a (BPI)Cu(I) species. The catalytic\\ncycle for ODA of cyclohexane to form N-allyl\\nproducts is presumably analogous to that of the catalytic ODC. This\\ncatalytic cycle would contain a copper–amidate resting state,\\nbased on mechanistic investigations of a related copper-catalyzed\\namidation of unactivated alkanes.28\\nProposed Catalytic Cycle of Cu-Catalyzed ODC of Cyclohexane\\nIn summary, we have described a copper-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenative\\ncarboxylation (ODC) of unactivated alkanes with a variety of\\nbenzoic acids to produce the corresponding allylic ester products.\\nA measurement of kinetic isotope effects showed that the turnover-limiting\\nstep is C–H bond cleavage, and experiments to trap radical\\nintermediates revealed that a transient tert-butoxy\\nradical cleaves the C–H bond of the alkane to generate an alkyl\\nradical. Reactions of alkyl radicals with a combination of Cu(II)–amidates\\nand Cu(II)–benzoates revealed that the alkyl radical reacts\\nfaster with a Cu(II)–amidate than with a Cu(II)–benzoate\\nto form N-alkyl products. Additional mechanistic\\ninvestigations indicated that the electronic properties of the Cu(II)–X\\n(X = amidate, benzoate) resting state contributes to the partitioning\\nof the alkyl radical between ligand transfer to form the alkyl–heteroatom\\nbond and electron transfer to oxidize the alkyl radical to an olefin,\\nfollowed by oxidative carboxylation to produce an allylic ester.\\nThe reaction of the alkyl radical with a Cu(II)–amidate versus\\na Cu(II)–benzoate is the step that distinguishes copper-catalyzed\\namidation and copper-catalyzed ODC of the alkane.\\nThis\\ninsight into the mechanism of ODC of cyclohexane led\\nto preliminary observations of copper-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenative\\namination of cyclohexane with electron-deficient nitrogen\\nsources (i.e., phthalimide and an electron-deficient sulfonamide)\\nto form N-allyl products. Current efforts are underway\\nto discover reaction conditions to suppress ligand transfer and favor\\nelectron transfer to achieve high selectivity for a copper-catalyzed\\nODA of unactivated alkanes.\\n',\n",
       " 'The relationship in blood between oxygen saturation (SO2) and partial pressure (PO2) is described graphically by the oxygen–haemoglobin dissociation curve (ODC) (figure 1). As defined above, SO2 represents the overall percentage of haemoglobin binding sites which are occupied by oxygen. Each haemoglobin molecule can bind reversibly up to four oxygen molecules; in addition, haemoglobin has the property that the binding of one oxygen molecule facilitates the binding of subsequent oxygen molecules. Consequently, the affinity of each haemoglobin molecule for oxygen increases until all four of its binding sites are occupied. This binding of oxygen to the haemoglobin molecule accounts for the increasing slope of the ODC at low levels of oxygenation. At higher oxygenation, the curve flattens off as all the haemoglobin molecules approach full saturation, resulting in the characteristic sigmoid (s-shaped) appearance (figure 1).\\nThe partial pressure of oxygen (also known as the oxygen tension) is a concept which often causes confusion. In a mixture of gases, the total pressure is the sum of the contributions of each constituent, with the partial pressure of each individual gas representing the pressure which that gas would exert if it alone occupied the volume. In a liquid (such as blood), the partial pressure of a gas is equivalent to the partial pressure which would prevail in a gas phase in equilibrium with the liquid at the same temperature. With a \\xadmixture of gases in either the gas or liquid phase, the rate of diffusion of an individual gas is determined by the relevant gradient of its partial pressure, rather than by its concentration. While in a gas mixture, the partial pressure and concentration of each gas are directly proportional, with oxygen in blood the relationship is more complex because of its chemical combination with haemoglobin. This allows blood to carry an enormously greater concentration (content) of oxygen than, for example, water (or blood plasma). Measurement of PO2, therefore, does not give direct information about the amount of oxygen carried by blood. The use of arterial PO2 (PaO2) as a valid index of arterial oxygenation is justified because measurements are interpreted with implicit assumptions about the ODC. In addition, PaO2 is important because most oxygen-dependent physiological systems, such as oxygen sensing, respond to changes in PO2 in their microenvironment.\\nThe relation between blood oxygen saturation (or content) and partial pressure is not constant, even within an individual. Classically the factors recognised to influence the oxygen dissociation curve (ODC) include the local prevailing CO2 partial pressure (PCO2), pH and temperature. The curve is shifted to the right (i.e. lower saturation for a given PO2) by higher PCO2, greater acidity (lower pH) and higher temperature. The effect of PCO2 (known as the “Bohr effect”) is mediated largely by the accompanying change in acidity; in vitro studies have shown that PCO2 itself also has an independent effect, which becomes most evident under more acidic and severely hypoxic conditions [4].\\nThe factors which shift the ODC to the right (lower pH, higher temperature and PCO2) are directly relevant to the conditions which prevail in metabolising tissues and consequently, as blood flows through the tissues, the ODC shifts to the right. This implies a reduction in the affinity of the blood for oxygen (for a given PO2, venous blood contains less oxygen than arterial blood), which is advantageous as it facilitates the unloading of oxygen from haemoglobin in the tissues. The converse occurs during passage through the pulmonary capillaries, with the greater affinity accompanying a shift of the ODC to the left aiding the uptake of oxygen.\\nA further compensatory mechanism which aids oxygen delivery by altering the position of the ODC is the concentration in the red cells of 2,3-biphosphoglycerate (also known as diphosphoglycerate (DPG)), an intermediate metabolite in the glycolytic pathway which binds to deoxyhaemoglobin. Higher concentrations of 2,3-DPG, seen, for example, with chronic hypoxia, shift the curve to the right, again facilitating the extraction of oxygen by metabolising tissues.\\nAs prevsiouly discussed, the blood oxygen content is directly proportional to the haemoglobin concentration and, consequently, anaemia (and polycythaemia) has largely predictable effects on the ODC. In simple terms, a reduction of haemoglobin concentration to half of the normal value is accompanied by a similar reduction in arterial oxygen content with no (or very little) change in % saturation or PaO2 (figure 2). Despite reduced oxygen carriage by the blood, tissue oxygen consumption is likely to show little change and is maintained by several compensatory factors, including higher cardiac output and greater extraction of oxygen by the tissues. Consequently, the blood “reserve” of oxygen is diminished and the venous oxygen content, saturation and partial pressure are all less than normal.\\nA large number of genetically determined abnormal haemoglobins have been described, one of the more familiar being HbS which is found in patients with sickle cell disease. In individuals with a haemoglobinopathy, the abnormal molecules comprise a variable proportion of the total haemoglobin and consequently, the effects are similarly variable. Compared to the normal adult HbA, the abnormal haemoglobin molecules are associated with shifts of the ODC which can be either to the right (low oxygen affinity haemoglobins) or to the left (high oxygen affinity haemoglobins). The position of the ODC can be quantified by the P50, which is measured in vitro as the partial pressure of oxygen at a saturation of 50%. The P50 of normal adult blood is approximately 26\\u2005mmHg; low affinity haemoglobins are characterised by higher P50 and high-affinity haemoglobins by a lower than normal P50. Such abnormal haemoglobins can have major consequences for tissue delivery of oxygen but their effects are mitigated by various compensatory mechanisms, one of which is the haemoglobin concentration. High-\\xadaffinity molecules, by definition, release oxygen less readily than normal and, because tissue hypoxia is a stimulus to haemoglobin production, affected individuals often have polycythaemia. By contrast those with low affinity haemoglobins are usually anaemic.\\nCO competes reversibly with oxygen for binding sites on the haemoglobin molecule but haemoglobin has a much greater affinity (about 200-times) for the former and a large proportion of the binding sites will be occupied by CO, even at low partial pressure of CO. In addition, the presence of carboxyhaemoglobin results in a shift of the ODC to the left, further compromising tissue oxygen delivery.\\nThe reversible binding of oxygen by haemoglobin and the sigmoid shape of the ODC have been recognised for more than 100\\u2005years following the pioneering work of Bohr, Roberts, Barcroft and others [7]. Over the years several mathematical models have been used to describe the ODC with varying success [8, 9].\\nThe mean±sd\\nSO2 calculated using the Severinghaus equation was 0.16±1.12% less than that measured directly, with slight overestimation of SO2 in samples with PO2 <7.5\\u2005kPa (56\\u2005mmHg) and slight underestimation with PO2 between 7.5 and 14.5\\u2005kPa (109\\u2005mmHg). In order to compare the measured and calculated curves, PO2 values were grouped in terms of the nearest integer value between 4 and 17\\u2005kPa and the corresponding SO2 value was averaged (measured curve) or derived using the Severinghaus equation (calculated curve). Overall, we found that the simplified equation of Severinghaus estimated, with remarkable accuracy, the SO2 in blood from patients with normal pH and SO2 >70% (figure 3). The results of the samples with abnormal pH confirmed the Bohr effect of rightward shift of the ODC with \\xadacidaemia and leftward shift with alkalaemia (figure 4). However, among the specimens with normal pH, variation in PCO2 had no apparent effect on the ODC.\\nWhich relationship does the ODC represent?\\nWhich of the following causes a rightward shift of the ODC:\\n',\n",
       " 'EVs are now recognized as key actors in neuron-glia communication and their release by neurons and glial cells appears to be controlled by neurotransmitters (e.g. serotonin [90], glutamate [91]), intracellular calcium, but also, oxidative stress, microglia activation and neuro-inflammation [91–93]. The secretion of EVs by neurons, oligodendrocytes (ODC), astrocytes, microglia, and Schwan cells has been reported in-vitro and in-vivo [94–100]. Astrocytes, essential for trophic support of neurons but also very involved in cellular communications, release EVs [96, 101]. Under hyperthermia and oxidative stress, cultured astrocytes released EVs carrying the heat shock protein Hsp70 and synapsine I conferring pro-survival effects on neurons [102]. ODC treated with a calcium ionophore increase the release of exosomes containing myelin components [95].\\nThe secretion of exosomes by ODC also depends on the electrical activity of neurons and appears to be controlled by the neurotransmitter glutamate [103]. Indeed, exosomes produced by ODC regulate, in an autocrine fashion, the membrane expansion, axonal myelination and myelin formation in response to trophic factors of neuronal origin but do not influence the differentiation of their precursors [104]. Finally, exosomes derived from ODC augmented neuron integrity and survival, axonal maintenance and immune surveillance by transferring myelin proteins, lipids and miRNAs to neurons and microglia [103, 105].\\nMicroglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, were reported to secrete exosomes exhibiting similar protein content as B cell-derived exosomes and this in-vitro secretion is up-regulated following microglia activation with interferon treatment [97]. Serotonin released by neurons induced exosome secretion by microglia (both in murine microglial BV-2 cells and mouse primary microglia), suggesting that a neurotransmitter can control exosome release [90]. Microglia activation is normally neuroprotective, allowing the pruning of inactive synapses through phagocytosis of ODC-derived exosomes. However, their activation can also cause neurodegeneration, and propagation of inflammation by a mechanism which involves the uptake of microglia-derived exosomes [92].\\nIn rodent models as well as in humans, changes in miRNA expression after ischemic stroke have been reported [134]. Ischemia in rodents induced miRNA changes (192 miRNAs up-regulated and 95 miRNAs down-regulated) in cortical tissue [135]. These results suggest that certain miRNAs (those with altered expression following neurotoxic xenobiotic exposure) may act in a neuroprotective manner. This is further supported by studies in which individual miRNAs (e.g. neuron-enriched miR-29, Mir-132, and miR-124; astrocyte-enriched miR-146a and miR181) were shown to reduce neuronal death and to improve neurological outcomes after ischemia [134]. In addition, an in vitro study showed that EVs derived from ODC maintained neuron and axon integrity and exhibited pro-survival effects on neurons [93].\\n',\n",
       " 'According to a published theory MS is a two-stage disease, starting with RRMS that eventually leads to SPMS (28). The current evidence indicates that RRMS is caused by an autoimmune attack directed at the myelin sheaths, while oligodendrocytes (ODC) are (initially) spared and remyelination remains possible. Progressive MS is thought to be rather caused by age-associated degeneration of ODC and neurons, leading to insufficient repair and irreversible damage to the nervous system. However, data from pathology studies and from recent therapy trials in PPMS, such as the ORATORIO trial testing ocrelizumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human CD20, a broadly expressed surface marker of B lineage cells, support a role for autoimmune mechanisms also in progressive MS (29, 30).\\nThe two-stage pathogenic process observed in the rhMOG/CFA model (35) is graphically presented in Figure 2. The collective data (reviewed in subsequent paragraphs) indicate that the initiation phase of the model involves a combined autoimmune attack of pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cells, antibodies, macrophages (Mfs), and complement factors on CNS WM myelin (36). Via this pathway, which recapitulates the immunology of mouse EAE models, MS-like lesions are induced in the WM. As remyelination frequently occurred, we assume that the myelin-forming ODC are spared.\\nWorking concept for the transition of relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Depicted are two neurons, which send electrical signals (indicated with concentric circles) along axons to organs on which they project. The axons are enwrapped with protective myelin sheaths, which are produced and repaired by oligodendrocytes (ODC). (1) Healthy myelinated axons. (2) In RRMS, the myelin sheath, in this case of the right axon, is attacked by binding of an antibody, which recruits inflammatory cells, such as the depicted macrophage (Mf). The Mf releases myelinotoxic factors that cause demyelination. New myelin formation (remyelination) is possible as the oligodendrocyte is spared. (3) In progressive multiple sclerosis, the myelin-forming oligodendrocyte is killed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Conceptually, this leads to permanent loss of myelination.\\nAfter a variable period of time, a second immunopathogenic mechanism is activated, which is mediated by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) (35). In a model based on selective activation of the CTL, we found demyelination in the white as well as the GM of brain and spinal cord in the absence of myelin-binding antibodies, suggesting that demyelination may have been caused by a cytotoxic process that leads to the death of ODC (33).\\nIt was noticed that marmosets immunized with a synthetic peptide derived from rhMOG, representing residues 34–56, henceforth indicated as MOG34–56, formulated with the mineral oil IFA, elicited clinical EAE in >90% of the monkeys (33). The absence of innate stimulatory factors in the peptide–IFA formulation indicates that this highly refined model is based on the reactivation of antigen-experienced T and or B cells present in the healthy marmoset’s immune repertoire. We noticed that in the model induced with MOG34–56/IFA, GM lesions were found, which are devoid of ODC (Figure 3). However, these were usually limited in number and detectable only in a minority (±20%) of the monkeys. We assume that the cases that display GM lesions represent high responders to the immunization.\\nPatterns of gray matter (GM) demyelination in a monkey sensitized against MOG34–56 in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA).

In the initiation phase of the disease, WM lesions representing those found in RRMS are formed by the combined attack of inflammatory T helper 1 (Th1) cells and anti-MOG antibodies. In the course of the disease, a second pathway is activated mediated by CTL that attack ODC, inducing lesions in WM and GM, which resemble those found in progressive MS. The extent of demyelination is substantially amplified by the concomitant activation of myeloid cells.\\nThe second autoimmune pathway, for which thus far no equivalent process has been found in mouse EAE models, is activated after a variable period of time following EAE initiation and seems to dictate the EAE progression rate (35). This progression pathway 2 involves the activation of Caja-E restricted CD8+ CD56+ CTL specific for the epitope MOG40–48 which have the capacity to kill target cells pulsed with the MOG40–48 epitope (45). Of note, a similar type of T cells has been found in MS lesions in close proximity of HLA-E+ ODC, indicating a cytotoxic process (46). It is tempting to speculate that the absence of ODC in GM lesions formed in the MOG34–56/IFA model (Figure 3) is due to a similar process, but this needs to be formally proven. Treatment with ustekinumab at a late disease stage only delayed the onset of clinically evident EAE, indicating that Th1/Th17\\u2009cells have a less prominent pathogenic role than in the initiation phase of the disease (47).\\nThe presence of strongly autoaggressive T cells in the immune repertoire of healthy monkeys indicates that these either have escaped thymic selection or have been induced by antecedent exposure of the marmosets to mimicry epitopes expressed by an infectious agent. As will be discussed below, these options are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In the model induced with MOG34–56/IFA, we observed a dominant role of CD8+ CD56+ effector memory CTL, which are restricted by the non-classical Mhc class Ib allele Caja-E and specific for the epitope MOG40–48 (YRPPFSRVV) (45). Analysis of serum antibodies revealed that specificities binding myelin particles were absent (66), indicating that the autoaggressive CTL may be held directly responsible for the observed demyelination of WM and cortical GM in this model. The MOG40–48 epitope shares sequence identity as well as immunological cross-reaction with the major capsid protein of CMV, an immunodominant T cell antigen in the human population encoded in the UL86 open reading frame (73, 74). The restriction of antigen recognition by Caja-E, the expression of a natural killer (NK) cell marker (CD56), and the cross-reaction with a peptide derived from an immunodominant CMV antigen are reminiscent to NK-CTL involved in the control of CMV infection in humans (75). As was already mentioned, a similar type of T cells, albeit of different specificity, has been identified in MS lesions, where they seemed to be engaged in a cytotoxic interaction with HLA-E expressing ODC (46). Taken together, these observations led us to posit that pathology in this model may be caused by autoaggressive T cells related to human NK-CTL which cause demyelination by cytotoxic killing of ODC.\\nWe propose that in MS the MHC-E restricted NK-CTL that drive EAE progression via pathway 2 are triggered early in the disease by myelin antigens released from an idiopathic primary lesion, e.g., a microglia nodule, with a key role of EBV-infected B cells in the presentation of released antigen to the CTL. The fact that the MHC-E loci in humans and non-human primate are essentially invariant may explain why the effect of MHC-E genes on MS risk has not emerged in GWAS studies. In line with our proposal Zaguia et al. reported presence of CTL, albeit specific for another myelin antigen (MBP) in RRMS lesions in close proximity of HLA-E expressing ODC, which seem to undergo a cytotoxic attack (46). Although the lack of cross-reactive mAbs has hampered the full characterization of the autoaggressive IL-17+ve CTL that drive the progression pathway in marmoset EAE, the available evidence suggests that they may be related to or even identical with CD8+ CD161+ CD28− NK-CTL present in the human anti-CMV T cell repertoire; a similar T cell type has been implicated in MS (111). The activation of the progression pathway depends on presentation of the proteolysis-sensitive epitopes MOG40–48 by LCV-infected B cells. As discussed elsewhere (76), these vigilant CTL are characterized by reduced sensitivity to immune regulation by Treg cells and are insensitive to corticosteroids (76). Moreover, being antigen-experienced T cells, they are likely committed to a functional lineage and, therefore, refractory to treatments operating at the level of T cell activation and differentiation. This notion may explain the failure of immunomodulatory treatments in progressive MS.\\n',\n",
       " 'Modulation of Hb-O2 affinity to improve hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients.\\nThe oxygen dissociation curve (ODC) describes the dependency of the oxygen saturation on the oxygen partial pressure (PO2) [1]. With its sigmoid shape, the curve is subjected to right or left shifts, thereby changing hemoglobin-O2 affinity. An increase in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), in 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3 DPG) and in temperature as well as a decrease in pH lead to a right-shift of the ODC, decreasing oxygen affinity, and vice versa [1,2]. In hypoxemic conditions, a shift of the ODC can significantly alter arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and consequently arterial oxygen content (CaO2). With a PO2 of 60 mmHg, for instance, SaO2 may be around 81% [1] at a pH of 7.27 (corresponding to a PCO2 of 60 mmHg according to Siggaard-Andersen nomogram) and normal body temperature (37 °C), or about 90% at a pH of 7.4, 37 °C body temperature and an PCO2 of 40 mmHg [3]. Assuming a hemoglobin concentration of 12 g/dl, this corresponds to an increase in CaO2 from 13.0 to 14.5 ml/dl. Further assuming a cardiac output of 6 l/min, the delivery of oxygen (DO2) increases from 780 to 870 ml/min. This increase in DO2 by augmenting CaO2 is equivalent to a DO2 increase by rising cardiac output by approximately 0.7 l/min. This approximates the effect of low-to medium-dose Dobutamine, a commonly used inotrope [4]. The difference in SpO2 may even widen with lower PO2, due to the shape of the ODC, or changes in body temperature, leading to an even greater effect on DO2 as outlined before.\\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus [5]. The disease is characterized by symptoms of cough and high fever and causes primarily interstitial lung changes and is characterized by a dissociation between relatively well preserved lung mechanics and the severity of hypoxemia [5]. Intrapulmonary ventilation-perfusion mismatch, probably due to impaired hypoxic vasoconstriction, results in hypoxemic respiratory failure [6]. Oxygen administration via face mask or nasal cannula, high-flow-nasal oxygen or non-invasive ventilation are common first-line interventions to improve oxygenation and dyspnea in these patients [5]. In case of persistent hypoxemia or clinical deterioration, endotracheal intubation and invasive ventilation is required. In mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19, gentle ventilation with low tidal volume is recommended in order not to further damage the lungs [7,8]. Low tidal volume ventilation often results in hypercapnia, which is tolerated to pH levels as low as 7.2 (permissive hypercapnia) [9]. As outlined above, the consequence of the high PCO2 and increased body temperature is a shift of the ODC to the right, worsening hypoxemia. In these patients, the PO2 levels are on the steep part of the ODC, so that a small shift of the ODC may have a large effect on the oxygen affinity and thus on SpO2. The question arises whether shifting the ODC back to the left would improve oxygenation of COVID-19 patients.\\n5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) is an agent able to shift the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. 5-HMF reduces the P50 (PO2 at which 50% of hemoglobin is saturated with oxygen, a parameter indicating the position of the ODC) via allosteric modification of the hemoglobin [10]. Animal studies showed that under severe hypoxia conditions (FiO2: 5%), 5-HMF increased hemoglobin affinity, preserved systemic O2 delivery and partially was able to maintain microvascular oxygenation (i.e., by protecting arteriolar and venular vasodilation and blood flow) [10]. In swine exposed to severe hypoxia, 5-HMF treatment decreased P50, improved SaO2, and mitigated increases in pulmonary artery pressure [11]. Moreover, a recent study indicated that the substance might have cardiac protective properties by inhibiting L-type Ca2+ channels [12]. However, not only in animal and in vitro models beneficial effects were reported. 5-HMF was also found to increase the oxygen affinity in healthy subjects exposed to hypoxia and in sickle cell disease patients [13,14]. Additionally, the combined oral intake of 5-HMF and α-ketoglutaric acid increased SpO2 during cycling exercise at 3500 m in healthy subjects [15]. The oral intake of these 2 substances was also shown to reduce oxidative stress, to increase exercise capacity and to reduce ICU and hospitalization time in patients admitted for lung resection [16]. It is important to mention that these substances are available as nutritional supplements and that no relevance for humans concerning carcinogenic and genotoxic effects have been found for 5-HMF supplementation [17].\\nThis makes 5-HMF a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of hypoxemic COVID-19 patients. By facilitating oxygen loading and increasing SaO2, breathing exertion might be reduced. This could delay or even prevent invasive ventilation and hence save valuable intensive care capacity in a crisis like this. In ARDS patients undergoing lung protective ventilation with permissive hypercapnia, a left-shift of the ODC induced by 5-HMF might ameliorate oxygenation by counteracting the hypercapnia effect on the oxygen affinity. On the other hand, a left-shift of the ODC might impair peripheral O2 unloading, leading to an unchanged cellular oxygen supply despite an increased DO2. Even though comparability might be questioned, recent data on hypoxic exercise show that a high O2-affinity and hence enhanced oxygen uptake in the lungs, outweighed deficits in peripheral O2 unloading [2,18]. Additionally, it was reported previously that in hypoxic conditions O2 unloading from Hb does not require a right-shift of the ODC [19].\\nIn conclusion, the modulation of hemoglobin-oxygen affinity by 5-HMF might be worth investigating as a potential therapeutic target in hypoxemic respiratory failure, e.g. due to COVID-19.\\nNone.\\n\\n']"

       "\"Following inflammatory insults to white matter of the central nervous system (CNS), frequently myelin is poorly repaired in both humans and animals. This deficit in remyelination contributes to axonal dysfunction and associated neurological disability in multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common syndrome of inflammatory demyelination in humans. In MS and similar diseases, the inflammatory response is associated with damage of oligodendrocytes (ODC) and myelin (reviewed in  Hunter and Rodriguez, 1995 ). A number of histologically similar diseases of animals are of viral origin. One naturally occurring picornavirus, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), causes a slowly progressive myelopathy associated with inflammatory demyelinating lesions in spinal cord and brainstem (susceptibility and pathogenesis reviewed in  Rodriguez et al., 1987b ). This well-characterized mouse model of progressive MS has been useful in the study of immunological processes underlying CNS demyelination. More recently our laboratory has employed this model to study the promotion of myelin repair by immunological and pharmacological interventions (reviewed in  Miller and Rodriguez, 1995b ).\\nThe identification of the critical targets and possible mechanisms of action has been formidable, principally due to polyspecificity of SCH 94.03 and other RPA. One possible action is directly on the ODC. Immunohistochemical studies are complicated since monoclonal RPA react with intracellular antigens in most tissues. In the CNS, astrocytes, ependyma, microglia and ODCs are stained intracellularly ( Miller et al., 1996b ). Despite the reactivity with intracellular antigens of both CNS and other organs, antibody action is more likely determined by its cell surface reactivity. Neonatal mouse ODC cultures (3 weeks in vitro) contain morphologically mature ODC with punctate, cell-surface staining for SCH 94.03. About 50% of SCH 94.03-reactive ODC also express myelin basic protein, a marker of more mature ODC. However, SCH 94.03 does not react with ODC lipids or resemble the developmental and antigenic reactivity of the common ODC lineage markers ( Asakura et al., 1996a ). Thus, the issue has become, do biologically significant quantities of SCH 94.03 and other RPA reach and react with ODC in and near demyelinated lesions?\\nIn  35 S-SCH 94.03 antibody-treated animals, radiolabel localized to ODC, outer faces of myelin sheaths, and inner glial loop or axolemma; the internal lamellae of the myelin sheath were labeled in degenerating sheaths only. Heavily labeled areas were always associated with demyelination and perivascular inflammatory infiltrates; these lesions (17±4%) had an intense signal associated with degenerated myelin sheaths, persisting ODC, and inner margin of the pial surface. Most (75±4%) demyelinated lesions labeled less intensely in a pattern associated with myelin or glia (consistent with ODC), and only 8% showed no labeling. By the same criteria, autoradiographic control sections showed only 3% of lesions with any pial signal, 22% labeled sparsely, and 75% showed no grains at all. Moreover, control sections showed no heavily labeled parenchymal areas.\\nWe selected regions from the most heavily radiolabeled, demyelinated spinal cord lesions for further quantitative study by ultrastructural autoradiography ( Fig. 4 \\n                         ). Glial or axonal structures were labeled by 92% of observed silver grains. Although myelin and ODC had a similar cross-sectional area to axoplasm in our sampling (51% myelin and ODC, 49% axoplasm), silver grains ( n =22) were more likely to be found ( χ \\n                         2 ,  P <0.01) on ODC or myelin (81%) than the axoplasm (18%). Silver grains in contact with myelin or ODC were over the inner glial loop or axolemma (61%), outer myelin sheath (33%), or an ODC process (33%). Only 12% of grains labeling ODC were found solely over the myelin sheath proper.\\nThe association of radiolabeled SCH 94.03 with the membranes of CNS cells and myelin extends prior observations that this polyspecific, natural autoantibody reacts with a subset of well-differentiated ODC in vitro ( Asakura et al., 1996a ). Others have used  35 S isotopes to label the structures of the extracellular space and find a similar resolution for  35 S to less energetic  3 H, possibly due to the more energetic particles exiting the emulsion without reacting ( Brown et al., 1969 ). Ultrastructural autoradiography employs sections and emulsions approaching infinite thinness, permitting a half distance of about 200 nm; grain density is highest over the source and falls off exponentially ( Rogers, 1979 ). Our analysis of the pattern of reactivity suggests that labeled antibody enters the extracellular space and reacts with the outer surface of the ODC, myelin, and the inner glial loop or axolemma.\\nRemyelination-promoting antibodies, including mAb SCH 94.03, could promote myelin repair in part by interacting directly with ODC or myelin. Since demyelinated lesions accumulate over many months in these mice, the minority of heavily labeled lesions are likely to be those which have recent inflammation and BBB breakdown. Chronically demyelinated areas without perivascular infiltration probably have a relatively intact BBB, as they do in MS ( Traugott, 1987 ), and therefore have lesser amounts of radiolabel. Even in the case of relatively permeable malignant tumors with large quantities of a target antigen, a high uptake of antibody over 7 days is 0.01% of total antibody dose, which is a 3–40-fold concentration relative to other tissues ( Reilly et al., 1995 ).\\nAlthough SCH 94.03 can enter the CNS and associate with ODC in chronically TMEV-infected mice, the manner in which antibody binding promotes repair of CNS myelin is unknown. Even though antibodies have traditionally been assigned to a role in neutralizing and opsonizing infectious agents, other roles have been found including direct modification of ODC behavior in vitro ( Benjamins and Dyer, 1990 ). Antibodies to spinal cord or white matter can stimulate myelin component synthesis ( Lehrer et al., 1979 ) or division of rat ODC progenitors in vitro ( Rodriguez et al., 1987a ). Antibodies against ODC membrane lipids or proteins can modulate membrane components, cell structure, intracellular calcium, and ODC progenitor maturation ( Bansal et al., 1988 ;  Dyer and Benjamins 1988, 1991 ;  Bansal and Pfeiffer, 1989 ;  Cohen et al., 1990 ;  Dyer et al., 1991 ).\\nMore traditional actions of antibodies may indeed be important for remyelination. Complement fixation could clear injured or dead ODC in regions of demyelination, improving the substrate for repair by glial progenitor cells or persisting ODC. Possibly, complete clearance of injured, mature ODC from a demyelinated region may be required for efficient remyelination. ODC progenitor proliferation in vitro is impaired by high cell density, becoming down-regulated following differentiation of ODC ( Hunter and Bottenstein 1989, 1990, 1991 ). Finally, agglutination and opsonization of debris from ODC, myelin, and axons could increase the efficiency of phagocytosis, thereby limiting secondary cellular infiltration, minimizing immune activation to cryptic neural antigens, and protecting surviving white matter elements from further immune injury.\\nPotential mechanisms are not limited to purely an effect on the ODC. Indeed, most antibody remains outside the CNS and could have immunomodulatory activity. Exogenous Ig modulates the immune response in a number of human and animal immune diseases in an incompletely understood and probably multifactorial fashion. Natural autoantibodies such as SCH 94.03 have been proposed to have an immunomodulatory action ( Avrameas and Ternynck, 1993 ). Treatment of TMEV-infected mice decreases infiltration of T-lymphocytes into the CNS by 2–3-fold and impairs humoral immune responses to T-cell-dependent antigens ( Miller et al., 1996a ). Interleukin-2, produced by infiltrating CD4 +  T-cells during the inflammatory response, can impair proliferation of ODC progenitors of the mature brain phenotype ( Hunter and Bottenstein, 1990 ). Systemic actions of the antibody might occur through an anti-idiotypic antibody network or by binding with specific immune cells. SCH 94.03 binds the dendritic cells of the thymus which are crucial for T-cell development ( Miller et al., 1996b ).\\n\""
