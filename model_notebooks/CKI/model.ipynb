       "\"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (CKIs) are therapeutic weapons in several advanced malignancies. Performance status is a validated prognostic variable in cancer patients; it possibly affects the efficiency of the immune system. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the predictive role of PS toward treatment with CKIs in cancer patients. Following PRISMA guidelines, an electronic search from PubMed, The Cochrane Library and Embase was performed, from the inception of each database to May 31, 2018. Inclusion criteria were (1) randomized trials comparing CKI with standard therapy for the treatment of patients with solid tumors; (2) information on overall survival (OS) according to PS; (3) full text available; and (4) reported in English language. Data were pooled using HRs for OS according to random effect model. The effect of experimental versus control arms was evaluated in PS\\u2009=\\u20090 and 1-2 subgroups, and the heterogeneity between the two estimates was assessed using an interaction test. The OS differences between PS\\u2009=\\u20090 and PS\\u2009=\\u20091-2 strata were evaluated in all studies and according to predefined subgroups. Eighteen studies were eligible, with 11,354 patients [PS\\u2009=\\u20090 group 5217 patients (46%); PS\\u2009=\\u20091-2 group 6137 patients (54%)]. The pooled HR for OS was 0.78 (95% CI 0.69-0.89) in PS\\u2009=\\u20090 patients. In PS\\u2009=\\u20091-2 patients, the pooled OS HR was 0.78 (95% CI 0.71-0.86). The OS difference between PS\\u2009=\\u20090 and PS\\u2009=\\u20091-2 patients treated with CKI was not significant (P\\u2009=\\u20090.99). CKI improves survival irrespective of patients' PS. PS should not guide treatment choice for anticancer immunotherapy.\\n\""

       "'The OsPCS2 exhibits root- and shoot-specific differential ratios of alternatively spliced transcripts in indica rice under Cd stress, and plays role in Cd and As stress tolerance and accumulation. Enzymatic activity of phytochelatin synthase (PCS) in plant produces phytochelatins, which help in sequestration of heavy metal(loid)s inside the cell vacuole to alleviate toxicity. Here we report that among the two PCS genes-OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 in indica rice (Oryza sativa) cultivar, the OsPCS2 produces an alternatively spliced OsPCS2b transcript that bears the unusual premature termination codon besides the canonically spliced OsPCS2a transcript. Root- and shoot-specific differential ratios of alternatively spliced OsPCS2a and OsPCS2b transcript expressions were observed under cadmium stress. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells transformed with OsPCS2a exhibited increased cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) tolerance and accumulation, unlike the OsPCS2b transformed yeast cells. An intron-containing hairpin RNA-mediated gene silencing was carried out in endosperm-specific manner for efficient down-regulation of OsPCS genes in rice grains. Analysis of the transgenic rice lines grown under metal(loid) stress revealed almost complete absence of both OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 transcripts in the developing seeds coupled with the significant reduction in the content of Cd (~51%) and As (~35%) in grains compared with the non-transgenic plant. Taken together, the findings indicate towards a crucial role played by the tissue-specific alternative splicing and relative abundance of the OsPCS2 gene during heavy metal(loid) stress mitigation in rice plant.\\n'"
