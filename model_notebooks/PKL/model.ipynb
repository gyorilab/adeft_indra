       "'Several proteins, including PKM2, play important roles in the metabolic reprogramming and growth of cancer cells ( 4 – 6 ). PKM2 is one of four pyruvate kinases (PKs) found in mammals ( 7 ). It is highly expressed in fetal cells and cancer cells, whereas the other isoforms (PKM1, PKR, and PKL) are expressed in normal somatic tissues. Replacement of PKM2 in cancer cells with any other PK isoform drastically reduces cancer cell survival in stress conditions (hypoxia ( 4 ) or glucose-depletion ( 8 )) and suppresses tumorigenicity ( 4 ). This suggests that subtle differences between this tumor-specific isoform and its normal cell counterparts are essential for tumor growth ( 4 ).\\nWe speculated that this delicate balance of cell growth and energy generation may be explained by assuming that there is an allosteric regulator of PKM2 coordinating the PK activity (and thus energy generation) in response to the cell’s metabolic demands. PKM2 is activated by the upstream glycolytic intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate [FBP; ( 7 )]. However, other PK isoforms (PKL and PKR) also activated by FBP cannot replace PKM2 for cancer cell growth in stress conditions ( 4 ,  7 ).\\n'"
