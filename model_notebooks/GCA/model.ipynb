       "'The phenotypic and genetic relationship between global cortical size and general cognitive ability (GCA) appears to be driven by surface area (SA) and not cortical thickness (CT). Gyrification (cortical folding) is an important property of the cortex that helps to increase SA within a finite space, and may also improve connectivity by reducing distance between regions. Hence, gyrification may be what underlies the SA-GCA relationship. In previous phenotypic studies, a 3-dimensional gyrification index (3DGI) has been positively associated with cognitive ability and negatively associated with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, and psychiatric disorders affecting cognition. However, the differential genetic associations of 3DGI and SA with GCA are still unclear. We examined the heritability of 3DGI, and the phenotypic, genetic, and environmental associations of 3DGI with SA and GCA in a large sample of adult male twins (N = 512). Nearly 85% of the variance in 3DGI was due to genes, and 3DGI had a strong phenotypic and genetic association with SA. Both 3DGI and total SA had positive phenotypic correlations with GCA. However, the SA-GCA correlation remained significant after controlling for 3DGI, but not the other way around. There was also significant genetic covariance between SA and GCA, but not between 3DGI and GCA. Thus, despite the phenotypic and genetic associations between 3DGI and SA, our results do not support the hypothesis that gyrification underlies the association between SA and GCA.\\nIn 515 middle-aged twins in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA;  Kremen et al., 2006 , 2013), we previously examined the genetic covariance among total SA, mean CT, and GCA ( Vuoksimaa et al., 2014 ). SA, rather than CT, drove the phenotypic and genetic associations between cortex and GCA. As noted, previous research suggests that gyrification is positively phenotypically associated with cognitive ability and negatively phenotypically associated with Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment. These findings raise the possibility that gyrification could be the underlying source of our observed SA-GCA relationships. We are unaware of any genetically informative studies of degree of gyrification or of the relationship between gyrification and cognitive ability. The goals of the present study were to: 1) estimate the heritability of gyrification; 2) examine the phenotypic and genetic associations between gyrification and SA, given that gyrification is related to SA; and 3) test whether gyrification underlies the relationship between SA and GCA.\\nIn order to determine the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors on 3DGI, we fit a trivariate (SA, 3DGI, GCA) model to the data. In the classical twin design, the variance of each phenotype is decomposed into the proportion of total variance attributed to additive genetic (A) influences, common or shared environmental (C) influences, and unique environmental (E) influences ( Eaves et al., 1978 ;  Neale and Cardon, 1992 ). The name ‘ACE model’ is derived from these three components of variance. Additive genetic influences are assumed to correlate 1.0 between MZ twins who generally share 100% of their genes, and .5 between DZ twins who on average share 50% of their segregating genes. Shared environment is assumed to correlate 1.0 between both members of a twin pair, regardless of twin zygosity. Unique environmental influences are assumed to be uncorrelated between the members of a twin pair. Measurement error is also included in the E term because it is also assumed to be uncorrelated between twins.\\nWe also examined whether phenotypes share common genetic and environmental determinants with 3DGI. We examined genetic covariance and environmental covariance of 3DGI with SA and with GCA. As can be seen in  Figure 1 , a Cholesky model decomposes the total covariance between phenotypes into genetic (A) and environmental components (C and E) such that the summed standardized genetic and environmental covariances are equal to the phenotypic correlation.\\nBecause gyrification is a property of SA, the two are likely to be strongly related to one another. Therefore, it was essential to include both phenotypes in the same model. In a trivariate Cholesky model, the first factor influences all three variables of interest ( Figure 1 ), while the second factor influences only the second and the third, and the third factor influences only the third variable. The models included SA, 3DGI, and GCA, in that order. Models were systematically tested to examine the worsening of the model fit caused by the removal of the various sources of variation; for example, examining the fit of the full model versus a model in which the genetic path between 3DGI and GCA is set to zero. This comparison tests whether removing the genetic path between 3DGI and GCA significantly diminishes the model fit or whether the 3DGI-GCA path is not important to the overall prediction of genetic variance in GCA. We additionally tested a nested model in which genetic path SA-GCA was set to zero. This comparison was to examine whether 3DGI contributes any genetic variance in GCA beyond what SA contributes to GCA.\\nVariance components from the full trivariate model are presented in  Table 2 , indicating a significant proportion of variance in each phenotype attributable to genetic factors. Within the full trivariate analysis of SA, 3DGI, and GCA, heritability of 3DGI was 0.71 (95%CI 0.62; 0.79). Influences of shared environment were nonexistent at 0.0 (95%CI 0.00; 0.38).\\nA scatterplot matrix of 3DGI, SA, CT, and GCA is presented in  Figure 2 .\\nThere was a significant positive phenotypic correlation between 3DGI and GCA (r p  = 0.17 [95% CI 0.09; 0.26]) and a significant positive phenotypic correlation between SA and GCA (r p  = 0.20 [95% CI 0.12; 0.29]). Given that 3DGI and SA were significantly phenotypically correlated with GCA and with each other, we estimated partial correlations to assess whether the phenotypic 3DGI-GCA correlation remained significant when accounting for SA, and whether the phenotypic SA-GCA correlation was reduced when accounting for 3DGI. The partial phenotypic correlation between 3DGI and GCA controlling for SA decreased the phenotypic correlation between 3DGI and GCA to 0.07 ( p  = ns). A partial correlation between SA and GCA after accounting for 3DGI decreased to 0.13 ( p  < .005). Thus, the latter correlation, between SA and GCA, remained significant even when accounting for 3DGI.\\nTrivariate models of SA, 3DGI, and GCA indicated that SA, but not 3DGI, accounted for a significant proportion of genetic variance in GCA.  Table 3  presents statistics for the trivariate model comparisons. Model 1 in  Table 3  was a full trivariate model examining A, C, and E components of each of the three phenotypes—SA, 3DGI, and GCA. Because there was virtually no shared environmental (C) variance in the two brain measures, as can be seen in  Table 2 , the full model was compared to a model in which the shared environmental variance components were removed from SA and 3DGI, but not removed from GCA (Model #2 in  Table 3 ). Model 2 was compared with the full model. This model retained a good fit to the data.\\nNext, we fit a similar model to Model 2 in which one of the paths, the additive genetic path from SA to GCA, was held to zero (Model 3). Model 3 resulted in a significantly worse model fit compared to either of the prior two models. Finally, we fit a model in which the additive genetic path from 3DGI to GCA was held to zero (Model 4). Model 4 was also compared to Model 2. Model 4 did not reflect a significant reduction in fit to the data based on the change in - 2LL, and it also had the lowest AIC value. Therefore, we considered Model 4 to be the best fitting model, suggesting that 3DGI did not account for much of the shared genetic covariance between SA and GCA.\\nA diagram of the best fitting model (Model 4) is depicted in  Figure 1 . Here the A path (the genetic variance) from 3DGI to GCA is removed.\\nWe also found that there were relatively strong phenotypic and genetic associations between SA and 3DGI. These findings were expected given that 3DGI is, in part, a surface area measure. Nevertheless, the correlations of about .6 also indicate substantial phenotypic and genetic variance that is unique to each. In addition, the fact that evolutionarily there is a strong relationship between increased gyrification and increased cognitive capacity raised the possibility that the SA-GCA association that we previously reported might be driven primarily by gyrification. Although 3DGI was correlated with GCA almost as strongly as SA, partialling out the variance in SA resulted in a nonsignificant 3DGI-GCA correlation. In contrast, the SA-GCA correlation remained significant after partialling out 3DGI. Our results also suggested that genetic substrates of GCA vary as a function of genetic changes in SA, but less so as a function of genetic changes in 3DGI. Therefore, the idea that the SA-GCA correlation is mostly a function of 3DGI was not supported in the present study.\\nThe debate about a possible association of gyrification with cortical thickness is still unresolved. Recently our group found research has suggested that genetic variance in GCA is more closely associated with SA than CT ( Vuoksimaa et al., 2014 ). Previous research on CT and GCA is mixed, with approximately half of studies reporting positive results and half reporting negative results. Inconsistencies across these studies, moreover, do not appear to be associated with the age of the samples. Overall, fewer studies of SA and GCA exist than of CT and GCA, but SA studies have been more consistently positive ( Vuoksimaa et al., 2014 ).\\nSome limitations should be noted with regard to this study. First, the current study used a global index of gyrification. Thus, with this measure it is not possible to ascertain whether gyrification within some predefined regions of interest are more relevant to GCA than others. Future studies using a local gyrification index ( Schaer et al. 2008 ,  2012 ) or other measures such as sulcal depth may be able to address the issue of localizing areas of greater or lesser association between gyrification and cognition. Second, only male twins participated in this study, precluding any examination of sex differences. It is a strength, however, that the VETSA sample is an age-homogenous and a national, rather than a local, sample.\\nIt is important to note that gyrification might be related to age. Although the recent reviews of twin structure do not suggest striking differences in heritability of cortical structures, it is possible that genetic and environmental variance differ at different stages of development. Middle-age is a time at which neurodegenerative processes become increasingly detectable, and so the estimated genetic factors may include those associated with cerebral health. Thus, we do not know if these results will generalize to other age groups. At almost any age some change is observed to be occurring, but heritability estimates in our sample are comparable to those of other age groups. Reviews of twin studies of brain structure have not found consistent differences in heritability estimates for young and middle-aged adults (Blokland et al., 2012). In a 5-year follow up of the VETSA sample we did not observe changes, though we will need additional longitudinal data to determine if genetic and environmental variance differentially affect degree of neurodegeneration. Both 3DGI and SA have been reported to decrease with age in a cross-sectional study (Hogstrom et al., 2012). Whether the phenotypic or genetic SA-GCA or 3DGI-GCA associations change in later life is a question that can be addressed in planned follow-up assessments.\\nIn conclusion, we found that degree of gyrification was highly heritable, and both cortical SA and degree of gyrification were associated with GCA in midlife adults. The fact that degree of gyrification—which is a property of SA—may be associated with improved cortical connectivity, and that across species gyrification is associated with cognitive capacity led us to examine whether gyrification might be what was driving the phenotypic and genetic associations between SA and GCA. However, our findings did not support the notion that gyrification was the underlying reason that cortical SA was associated with GCA.\\nA path diagram depicting a trivariate Cholesky decomposition. Within twin pairs, covariance shared by the three phenotypes (shown in boxes) is generated by latent additive genetic (A), shared environmental (C), and unique environmental (E) components (shown in circles). The genetic correlation is the standardized genetic covariance (e.g., a 11 *a 21  / √(a 11 2  * (a 21 2 +a 22 2 )) (A), while the unique environmental correlation is the proportion of variance shared due to unique (unshared) environmental causes (e.g., e 11 *e 21  / √(e 11 2  * (e 21 2 +e 22 2 )) (E). All latent variables A have fixed variances of 1.0 (not shown). Presented here is the best fitting trivariate model of SA, 3DGI, and GCA. Numbers reflect the standardized estimates within the best fitting model along with 95% confidence intervals. This figure corresponds to model 4 in  Table 3 , in which the shared additive genetic variance between 3DGI and GCA is held to zero. Hence, there is no a 32  path. There are also no C components for SA or 3DGI in this model because they were also set to zero in this best fitting model. For simplification of presentation, the model shows only one twin.\\nScatterplot matrix showing values of gyrification, SA, CT, and GCA plotted against one another. All variables have been z-scored and adjusted for age and scanner. Along the bottom row are plots of gyrification with SA, CT, and GCA. The row above depicts plots of SA against CT and GCA. Finally, the topmost graph depicts CT plotted against GCA.\\nAll statistics are based on the full trivariate model of SA, 3DGI, and GCA.\\nSA = cortical surface area, 3DGI = gyrification index, GCA = general cognitive ability.\\nModel 2 reflects a model in which A and E components are estimated for all variables, and C is estimated only for GCA (a slight improvement in fit). Models 3 and 4 reflect variations of model 2, in which the genetic correlation (path a) between SA or 3DGI and GCA is set to 0. Model comparison statistics reflect the fit of model 2 compared to model 1, and submodels 3 and 4 tested against of model 2. Model 4 (the best fitting model based on AIC) is also depicted in  Figure 1 .\\n'"

       "'Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with mutated or rearranged oncogene drivers can be treated with upfront selective inhibitors achieving higher response rates and longer survival than chemotherapy. The RET gene can undergo chromosomal rearrangements in 1%–2% of all NSCLC patients, involving various upstream fusion partners such as KIF5B, CCDC6, NCOA4, and TRIM33. Many multikinase inhibitors are active against rearranged RET. Cabozantinib, vandetanib, sunitinib, lenvatinib, and nintedanib achieved tumor responses in about 30% of these patients in retrospective studies. Prospective phase II trials investigated the activity and toxicity of cabozantinib, vandetanib, sorafenib, and lenvatinib, and did not reach significantly higher response rates. VEGFR and EGFR inhibition represented the main ways of developing off-target toxicity. An intrinsic resistance emerged according to the type of RET fusion partners, as KIF5B-RET fusion is the most resistant. Also acquired mutations in rearranged RET oncogene developed as resistance to these multikinase inhibitors. Interestingly, RET fusions have been found as a resistance mechanism to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients. The combination of EGFR and RET inhibition can overcome this resistance. The limitations in terms of activity and tolerability of the various multikinase inhibitors prompted the investigation of new highly selective RET inhibitors, such as RXDX-105, BLU-667, and LOXO-292. Some data emerged about intracranial antitumor activity of BLU-667 and LOXO-292. If these novel drugs will achieve high activity in RET rearranged NSCLC, also these oncogene-addicted tumors can undergo a significant survival improvement.\\nIn all these cases, even in those with longer progression-free survival, resistance occurs. To date many resistance mechanisms have been known and, as a consequence, novel targeted drugs have been developed to deal with the inefficacy of previous treatment. Resistance mutations can be detected through the re-biopsy of tumor tissue or the so-called “liquid biopsy”, intended as the analysis of blood samples to find DNA alterations. 3  Among the various oncogene drivers in NSCLC the  RET  gene is involved in various chromosomal rearrangements, which can be found in 1%–2% of all NSCLC patients. 4  The current availability of RET inhibitors raises the possibility to spare this small proportion of NSCLC patients from chemotherapy and offer the opportunity of a further effective targeted therapy after failure of chemotherapy.\\nIn this review, we discuss the biological significance of the  RET  gene, the available RET-directed drugs, and relative clinical trials for NSCLC patients and resistance mechanisms occurring during the treatment with RET inhibitors.\\nIn 1985,  RET  was identified as a novel transforming gene as result of transfection of the NIH 3T3 cell with high molecular weight DNA of a human T-cell lymphoma. The gene was activated by a DNA rearrangement in which two unlinked segments of human DNA recombined to generate a new transcriptional unit. 5  Subsequently, studies mapped RET to chromosome 10q11.2, where it encodes for a receptor tyrosine kinase. 6\\nMutations of RET determine the absence of enteric ganglia from the distal colon (Hirschsprung’s disease) and congenital megacolon, besides RET.k-/RET.k- mice lack all enteric ganglia, demonstrating a RET important role in the development of the enteric nervous system. 7  Still in the embryonic phase a RET-dependent cell rearrangement generates a specialized epithelial domain that later emerges as the tip of the primary ureteric bud. 8  As well as in the embryonic phase RET is important in homeostasis of several tissues including neural, neuroendocrine, hematopoietic, and male germ tissues. 9\\nRET is a single-pass transmembrane protein with a typical intracellular tyrosine kinase domain ( Figure 1 ). While a “classical” activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is due to the interaction ligand-receptor, the activation of RET requires an interaction between its ligands (the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor-family ligands, GFLs) and a co-receptor (GFLs family receptor-alfa). 5  The GFL–GFRα complex binds to the extracellular domain of RET, leading to the phosphorylation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and consequently the activation of several pathways, including MAPK, PI3K, JAK-STAT, PKA, and PKC. 10\\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome is defined as a disorder with neoplasms in two or more different hormonal tissues. Each of these syndromes also includes one or more additional neoplasms. MEN1 is characterized by specific hormonal tumors: parathyroid adenoma (90%), gastrinoma (40%), and prolactinoma (30%), plus additional hormone-producing tumor with a range between 1% and 10% (insulinoma, glucagonoma, VIPoma, somatostatinoma, pituitary tumors, thymic carcinoid, bronchial carcinoid, gastric carcinoid, adrenal cortex, and pheochromocytoma). 11  The  MEN1  gene, mapped at chromosome 11q13, encodes for a protein, menin, that is involved in organogenesis of neural tube, heart, and craniofacial structures and hematopoiesis. 12  A germline mutation of the MEN1 leads to tumor development mainly via a biallelic loss-of-function mechanism. 11  MEN2A are characterized by medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism. MEN2B has the same features as MEN2A, plus intestinal ganglioneuromas and the mucosal neuroma phenotype, but a different hormonal disorder profile. 13  During the 90 seconds, the International RET Mutation Consortium enrolled 477 independent MEN2 families worldwide to investigate the association between the position and type of germline mutation in the RET proto-oncogene and the presence or absence of medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, primary hyperparathyroidism, and other. Overall, 92% of MEN2 families had a germline RET mutation in one of eight codons. Over 95% of families with MEN2B had a mutation in codon 918, and each of the three MEN2A categories were found to have mutations at cysteine codons 609, 611, 618, 620, and 634. 14  These mutations determine a ligand-independent constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor leading to an uncontrolled activation of the MAPK and the PI3K pathways that results in uncontrolled growth and cell de-differentiation. 15  In addition to the RET point mutations, several gene rearrangements were identified in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), known as RET/PTC rearrangements. Each distinct chromosomal translocation is characterized by the promoter and 5′ region of a heterologous gene encoding a thyrocyte-expressed protein fused, in frame, to the kinase-encoding 3′ end of the RET proto-oncogene. 16  To date, 13 different oncogenic RET/PTC fusion proteins (termed RET/PTC1-PTC9) have been discovered. These chimeric proteins are characterized by coiled-coil domains that induce dimerization and activation of the kinase domain. This capability to form dimers is required for oncogenic activation, leading to an uncontrolled activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways, similarly to the result of activating RET point mutations. 15 , 17  Interestingly, RET rearrangement are largely thought to be somatic events, as opposed to RET mutations that can occur in the germ line or be acquired somatically.\\nFirst, in 2011 RET rearrangement was discovered in a young never-smoking male patient with lung adenocarcinoma. 18  As aforementioned, 1%–2% of NSCLCs harbor a RET rearrangement. 4  While the correlation between ionic radiation and RET rearrangements is clearly confirmed in PTC, in NSCLC this correlation remains unclear, even if in vitro experiments demonstrated the possibility to induce RET rearrangement in human lung cancer cells by radiation. 19  To deepen the knowledge of RET in NSCLC, Wang et al 20  examined the  RET  fusion gene in 936 patients with surgically resected NSCLC using a PCR strategy. These patients seemed to have identifiable clinicopathologic characteristics, including younger age, never-smoker status, early lymph node metastases, poor differentiation, and a solid-predominant subtype. As well as the other main driving-mutations, RET rearrangement seems to be mutually exclusive, suggesting that it might be a targetable oncogenic driver. 21\\nThe first RET rearrangement identified in NSCLC patients was an in-frame fusion transcript of the kinesin family 5B gene ( KIF5B ) with  RET  gene (KIF5B-RET). Other upstream fusion partners for RET rearrangement have been identified in NSCLC, such as the coiled-coil domain-containing protein 6 ( CCDC6 ), the nuclear receptor coactivator 4 ( NCOA4 ), the tripartite motif-containing 33 ( TRIM33 ), myosin VC gene ( MYO5C ), EPH receptor A5 gene ( EPHA5 ), CAP-Gly domain containing linker protein family member one gene ( CLIP1 ), ELKS/RAB6-interacting/CAST family member one gene ( ERC1 ), phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein gene ( PICALM ), FERM domain containing 4A gene ( FRMD4A ) RUN and RYVE domain containing two gene ( RUFY2 ), and tripartite motif containing 24 gene ( TRIM24 ). All of these fusion counterparts have a dimerization domain that induces ligand-independent activation of the RET kinase ( Figure 1 ). 22 , 23\\nThe majority of drugs active against RET are multikinase inhibitors. The approval of these agents is not restricted to patients harboring alterations in  RET  gene. Among these drugs, we can mention those approved for thyroid cancer, such as cabozantinib, vandetanib, lenvatinib, and sorafenib, but also other multikinase inhibitors approved for other malignancies, including alectinib, sunitinib, nintedanib, regorafenib, and ponatinib. The action of these drugs against RET kinase allows a classification in type I and type II inhibitors. The first ones (ie, vandetanib and sunitinib) bind the ATP-binding domain in its active conformation. The latter ones bind the same domain, but in the inactive conformation. 24 , 25\\nThe effects of these drugs on RET rearrangements with various upstream partners or breakpoints were studied by means of engineered and patient-derived RET-rearranged cell lines and xenograft models. 26  These experimental models have been useful to identify the activity of other agents against RET rearranged kinase (eg, RXDX-105, BLU-667, LOXO-292). 27 – 30  These studies demonstrated the effect on rearranged RET kinase, but the multikinase inhibition also induced the blockade of many downstream pathways such as MAPK, PI3K, and PLCγ with a consequent decrease of cell proliferation.\\nIn 2015, a retrospective analysis was performed on data from the Global Multicenter RET Registry (GLORY), which collected the experiences of the treatment with multikinase inhibitors in RET-rearranged NSCLC patients. 31  Interesting findings emerge from this analysis. Multikinase RET inhibitors were administered in various lines of systemic therapy ranging from first to eighth, with a median of third line. In fact, median time from diagnosis to the beginning of anti-RET therapy was 12 months. Among the various drugs only cabozantinib, vandetanib, sunitinib, lenvatinib, and nintedanib achieved tumor responses, ~30%, whereas no responses were observed with alectinib, regorafenib, sorafenib, or ponatinib ( Figure 2A ). None of the outcome measures (response rate, progression-free survival [PFS], overall survival [OS]) changed depending on upstream fusion partners (eg, KIF5B, CCDC6, EPHA5) of  RET  gene. Median PFS of 2.3 months and median OS of 6.8 months were reported. The majority of patients (about 80%) received only one multikinase RET inhibitor. Moreover, this registry also provides information about the efficacy of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in RET-rearranged NSCLC, which reached about 50%. These results in terms of response rate and PFS are partially concordant with those from phase II trials, which had studied or were studying the same drugs in RET-rearranged NSCLC patients.\\nTo date in this subpopulation, five phase II trials with multikinase RET inhibitors have been completed ( Figure 2B ). One single arm phase II trial studied cabozantinib, a multikinase inhibitor active against VEGFR2, MET, ROS1, AXL, KIT, and TIE2, but with low activity against RET (IC50=5.2 nM). 32  The patients in this study were not previously treated with RET inhibitors. About one-third of these patients responded to cabozantinib, but no complete responses were observed. Moreover, responses were early, with a high tumor shrinkage (≥30% tumor reduction in 70% of patients). The median overall survival reached 9.9 months.\\nVandetanib is another multikinase inhibitor against VEG-FRs, EGFR, and RET, with higher IC50 than cabozantinib. It was studied in two phase II trials conducted in Eastern countries (Korea and Japan). 33 , 34  The objective response rate (ORR) was 18% and 53%, for median PFS of 4.5 and 4.7 months, respectively. The most common adverse effects of vandetanib were hypertension because of VEGFR inhibition, skin toxicity and diarrhea because of EGFR inhibition, and also manageable prolonged QT interval. Interestingly in these studies the differences in the types of upstream fusion partners of  RET  gene were documented. In the Korean study, the KIF5B-RET rearrangement was associated with no objective response, unlike CCDC6-RET fusion. They also found the novel rearrangement MYO5C-RET, which is characterized by the exclusion of RET transmembrane domain with consequent ligand-independent RET activation. Accordingly in the Japanese trial higher ORR (83% vs 20%) and longer PFS (8.3 vs 2.9 months) were achieved with CCDC6-RET than KIF5B-RET rearrangements.\\nAlso sorafenib was studied in a phase II trial for NSCLC patients with RET rearrangement. 35  Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor which targets intracellular (ie, CRAF, BRAF and mutated BRAF) and cell surface (ie, KIT, FLT3, VEGFRs and RET) molecules. It has anti-RET activity with IC50=5.9–47 nM. In a preclinical model, sorafenib was active against KIF5B-RET fusion. 36  In the only three patients treated with sorafenib in this study, no significant response was reported, but tumor shrinkage and symptom improvement were observed along with durable stable disease in one patient.\\nFinally, lenvatinib, a multikinase inhibitor against VEGFRs, PDGFR-β, and RET, has an IC50 for anti-RET activity of 35 nM. It was evaluated for antitumor activity in RET fusion positive patients with lung adenocarcinoma within a phase II study. Among 25 patients, ORR was 16% and median PFS 7.3 months. Grade 3–4 adverse events were experienced in 92% of patients, with hypertension, nausea, anorexia, diarrhea, proteinuria, and vomiting as the most common toxicities. 37\\nThe results of these clinical trials with multikinase inhibitors have revealed that not all RET-rearranged patients are responsive to these drugs. Objective response rates of 28% and 47%, 32 , 34  respectively obtained with cabozantinib and vandetanib, suggest the existence of intrinsic resistance mechanisms. First of all, the type of RET fusion partner seems to influence the response to treatment, as documented with vandetanib, which induced worse outcomes in the presence of KIF5B-RET fusion than with CCDC6-RET fusion. However, the phase II study with cabozantinib did not confirm this finding. Some preclinical studies showed that the presence of KIF5B upstream of RET induces an increase of RET transcription, whereas the presence of other fusion partners, such as CCDC6, is associated with a lower degree of RET expression. This aspect could influence the response to RET inhibition, 38 , 39  but more studies should be performed to address this issue. Moreover, KIF5B-RET fusion can strongly activate a signaling hub of various kinases, such as RET, EGFR, SRC, FGFR. This effect was not observed for other RET rearrangements (ie, CCDC6-RET and NCOA4-RET) and can be overcome through inhibiting both RET and EGFR, as Das and Cagan 40  demonstrated in an in vitro study. These findings are corroborated in vivo, as reviewed by Ferrara et al. 23  Patients with KIF5B-RET fusion mainly achieved lower overall response rates than patients with other RET fusions.\\nRecently, through other in vitro experiments, some missense RET mutations have been found associated with resistance to cabozantinib, lenvatinib, and vandetanib in patients with medullary thyroid cancer. In particular, the authors found a number of TKI-resistant mutations located in the Gly-rich loop (L730, E732, and V738), the gatekeeper residue (V804), or the hinge strand (Y806, A807, and G810) that comprise about two-thirds of the drug binding pocket. They also demonstrated that different aminoacid substitutions of the same site could have different consequences for drug resistance, suggesting that not only the site of the kinase but also the type of amino acid should be considered when evaluating drug sensitivity. 41\\nHowever, to date these mutations have not been observed in tumor samples from patients with RET-rearranged or RET-mutant cancer that have developed an acquired resistance to RET inhibitors. Recently, a case report showed a RET-rearranged lung cancer patient that developed a secondary RET mutation (S904F) at the onset of resistance to vandetanib. The mutation was a serine-to-phenylalanine substitution at codon 904 in the activation loop of the RET kinase domain and conferred resistance to vandetanib by increasing the ATP affinity and autophosphorylation activity of RET kinase. This result indicates that missense mutations in the activation loop of the kinase domain are able to increase kinase activity and confer drug resistance through allosteric effects. 42  Another case report described the effect of V804M gatekeeper mutation on resistance to vandetanib. 43\\nAs we know, in ALK rearranged patients, the frequency of ALK mutations as a resistance mechanism is higher in those patients receiving second generation ALK-inhibitors (alectinib or ceritinib), more potent than first generation inhibitors such as crizotinib, 44  suggesting that the potency of the drug in inducing a block of the target is associated with induction of resistance mutations on the target. This could suggest that more potent anti-RET agents could induce RET mutation, also indicating a more effective anti-RET activity, with respect to the current used agents.\\nConcurrent genomic alterations could also have a role in conferring resistance. Preclinical studies in a RET-rearranged lung cancer cell line showed that the EGFR-mediated signaling could mediate resistance to multikinase inhibition providing a rationale to cotarget EGFR to reduce the risks of developing drug resistance. 45 , 46  In the study by Chang et al, 45  CCDC6-RET positive lung cancer cells were highly sensitive to RET inhibition, but EGFR signaling was responsible for resistance to sunitinib, vandetanib, and sorafenib, through the induction of ERK and AKT activity. Moreover, they demonstrated that endothelial cells, which are known to produce EGF, decreased the sensitivity of RET inhibitors. In addition, the results of Vaishnavi et al, 46  performed on different models of lung cancer cell lines carrying ALK, ROS1, RET, and NTRK1 fusions, confirm that EGFR signaling was involved at different levels in determining resistance to multikinase inhibitors, and that treatment with the EGFR-TKI gefinitb abrogated all the EGFR contributions.\\nAnother potential resistance mechanism, both primary and acquired, is the MDM2 amplification. Pre- and post tumor biopsy were obtained from RET-rearranged lung cancer patients treated with cabozantinib, and amplification of the gene was observed in 50% of patients undergoing resistance, highlighting the possibility to combine anti-MDM2 agents with RET inhibitors. 47\\nAnother potential resistant mechanism to RET inhibition, observed in in vitro studies, is the activation of the MAPK pathway. By studying RET-rearranged cell lines treated with ponatinib, cell clones resistant to the drug were obtained and the molecular characteristics of those was studied. Although cells retained the expression of the RET fusion, phosphorylation lacked. The activation of the MAPK signaling was seen in both cell lines, in one case due to the induction of NRAS mutation and in the other model due to the overexpression of EGFR and AXL. 48  These results should be confirmed in a clinical setting and, if confirmed, could open the possibility for combinational treatment using MAPK-inhibiting drugs ( Table 1 ).\\nThe results in terms of activity and tolerability of the various multikinase inhibitors, active but not specific against RET, led us to investigate a new anti-RET specific kinase inhibitor, RXDX-105. Its IC50 is 0.3, 0.3–0.8, and 5–15 nM against wild-type RET, RET rearrangements, and mutated RET, respectively. VEGFRs are spared from inhibition by this drug. It was evaluated in a phase I trial including 28 RET-fusion positive NSCLC patients. The most common G3 adverse events reached no more than 10% and no G4 toxicity was reported. None of the patients with KIF5B-RET fusion experienced a response, whereas among patients with non-KIF5B-RET fusions ORR was 75%, suggesting a relevant role of patient selection according to rearrangement type. 49\\nBLU-667 is a novel small-molecule RET inhibitor. It has been designed for high potency and selectivity against oncogenic RET alterations, including the most frequent RET rearrangements (eg, KIF5B–RET and CCDC6–RET). It was tested preclinically in RET-driven thyroid, lung, and colorectal cancers. KIF5B–RET autophosphorylation was inhibited by BLU-667 in vitro over 20-fold more potently than RXDX-105. Durable responses without significant off-target toxicity in patients with RET-altered NSCLC and medullary thyroid cancer prompted clinical investigation. 29  A phase one open-label first-in-human study was designed for BLU-667 in patients with medullary thyroid cancer, RET-altered NSCLC, and other RET-altered solid tumors, and has been recruiting currently (NCT03037385). 50\\nLOXO-292 is another highly selective ATP-competitive RET inhibitor, which has nanomolar potency against diverse RET alterations, including anticipated acquired resistance mutations. It has advantageous pharmacokinetic features, such as high bioavailability, significant penetration of central nervous system, and low potential for drug interactions. 30  Patients with advanced RET-altered tumors, treated with any prior multikinase inhibitors, including lung cancer, are under recruitment in a phase 1/2, open-label, first-in-human study with LOXO-292 (NCT03157128). 51  In the meantime, a study of patients treated with LOXO-292 showed a rapid clearance of RET variants in cell-free DNA ( Table 2 ). 52\\nFew studies reported information on the frequency, responsiveness, and overall outcomes in RET-rearranged advanced NSCLC patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases. A recent paper by Drilon et al 53  focused on this topic. They showed that the frequency of CNS involvement in these patients is 25% at diagnosis, but lifetime prevalence can reach almost a half. Furthermore, the cumulative incidence of CNS lesions in RET-positive NSCLC patients is higher than ROS1-positive and lower than ALK-positive patients. They found a low intracranial response rate when these patients were treated with various multikinase inhibitors (alectinib, cabozantinib, ponatinib, sunitinib, vandetanib, vandetanib + everolimus): two of eleven patients (18%), one treated with alectinib and one with vandetanib + everolimus. In both these patients with responding CNS metastases, CCDC6-RET fusion was present. PFS and OS were short in patients with brain metastases: 2.1 months (95% CI =1.3–2.9 months) and 3.9 months (95% CI =1.9–5.4), respectively. However, these outcomes can echo the limited efficacy of multikinase inhibitors in RET-rearranged NSCLC patients. The combination of vandetanib and everolimus can represent an option to optimize blood–brain-barrier penetration as previously reported. 54  Some data about intracranial antitumor activity through the selective RET-directed inhibitors BLU-667 and LOXO-292 are emerging. 55 , 56\\nFirst, in 2015, some authors 57  reported two cases of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib, who developed CCDC6-RET fusion as detected via a hybrid-capture-based comprehensive genomic profiling assay in tumor tissue from rebiopsy. In another case, a retrospective analysis of the Foundation Medicine database allowed the identification of an acquired NCOA4-RET fusion in a NSCLC patient progressing on EGFR-TKI. 57\\nMore recently, the Foundation Medicine database was explored to identify EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients. The tumor and blood samples were analyzed for BRAF or RTK fusions. In four patients, three RET fusions were found (ie, CCDC6-RET, NCOA4-RET, and TRIM24-RET). After the appearance of these RET rearrangements during an EGFR-TKI, RET inhibitors were delivered. One patient with CCDC6-RET fusion post-erlotinib had no benefit to single-agent alectinib. Another patient with NCOA4-RET fusion post-afatinib experienced stable disease through the combination of afatinib and cabozantib. 58\\nAn in vitro model with EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell lines expressing CCDC6-RET showed that the combination of an EGFR-TKI with the selective inhibitor BLU-667 achieved a decrease in cell viability. In the same paper by Piotrowska et al, 59  some cases of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients treated with combined EGFR and RET inhibition after the occurrence of RET fusions are reported. One patient with CCDC6-RET fusion post-afatinib was treated with erlotinib plus cabozantinib, but obtained no significant benefit. In two other patients, one with CCDC6-RET post-osimertinib and one with NCOA4-RET post-afatinib/cetuximab, the combination of osimertinib and BLU-667 achieved significant tumor response with marked tumor shrinkage.\\nThese reports suggest that a selective RET inhibition combined with EGFR-TKI could help to manage acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs when RET fusions are documented as a resistance mechanism. However, specific clinical trials are needed to recommend this as a standard approach.\\nThe  RET  gene is one of the already known oncogenes undergoing activating rearrangements in a small subpopulation of lung cancer patients. The availability of multikinase inhibitors, active against RET among various targets, encouraged us to find a target therapy also for these patients. By using multikinase inhibitors to target RET, the consequent concomitant VEGFR and EGFR inhibitions lead to off-target toxicity. As a consequence these mutikinase inhibitors cannot be delivered at the dose necessary for RET inhibition. Both retrospective and prospective studies showed a good activity of some multikinase inhibitors in RET fusion positive NSCLC patients, but not sufficient to consider these drugs as a valid alternative to chemotherapy as achieved by EGFR- and ALK-inhibitors in other oncogene-addicted tumors. From these studies an intrinsic resistance emerged according to the type of RET fusion partners. Moreover, some acquired resistance mutations in rearranged RET were found during the treatment with multikinase inhibitors. Nowadays encouraging prospects derive from the development of selective RET inhibitors with high potency, but without off-target toxicity. Some early phase clinical trials are ongoing, giving the hope that soon new drugs will be available to specifically treat those 1%–2% of NSCLC patients with a RET rearrangement, sparing them from first-line chemotherapy.\\nSchematic structure of wild-type and rearranged RET proteins in a cancer cell.\\nSummary of known mechanisms of resistance to RET inhibition\\nSummary of new RET-specific drugs\\n'"
