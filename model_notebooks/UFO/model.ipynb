       "'The fully reprogrammed pluripotency can be sorted into ICM-like state (naïve) and post-implantation epiblasts state (primed) 23 . Dissections of each pluripotent state indicated that the naïve state was dependent on JAK/STAT signaling that was activated by LIF, and the primed state was dependent on PI3K/AKT and ALK/SMADs signaling that was activated by b-FGF and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)/Activin A. The primed state pluripotency in human and mouse PSCs showed similar gene expression profiles and culture requirements 24 – 26 ; however, the naïve pluripotency was different between the two species, which required different stimulations 24 , 27 – 30 . Unfortunately, both defined states were illusive in pig since none of the above conditions were capable of deriving fully reprogrammed porcine ESCs 31 . The species-related regulatory signaling pathway as reported in mouse and human PSCs is likely to be applied in pig and other animals 32 , in which PI3K/AKT and TGF-beta signaling pathways, instead of LIF and b-FGF signaling pathways, may play key roles in maintaining porcine stem cell pluripotency 33 , 34 . Consequently, a composition of different stimulations may be required for the derivation of porcine PSCs that meet all the criteria of authentic pluripotency.\\n'"
